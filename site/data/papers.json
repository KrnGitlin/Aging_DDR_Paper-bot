Telomerase is expressed in immune cells yet leukocyte telomere length declines during ageing suggesting an age-dependent loss of telomerase activity in the immune system. Leukocyte telomere length has been correlated with worse outcomes in TB patients, however the mechanisms linking telomere biology to TB susceptibility and response to therapy are unexplored. Here we use the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to investigate the role of telomerase in TB resistance. We find depletion and inhibition of Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, increases bacterial burden in zebrafish embryos. The Tert depletion infection susceptibility phenotype could not be rescued by p53 or STING depletion suggesting a non-canonical role for Tert in controlling mycobacterial infection. Consistent with a previously described role for Tert in developmental hematopoiesis, we find Tert is necessary for demand-driven emergency myelopoiesis to support containment of extended mycobacterial infection. Our findings establish a previously undescribed role for host telomerase in supporting infection demand-driven hematopoiesis to control infection.",

    "summary": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), has evolved strategies to evade innate immunity and establish persistent infection. However, the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis reprograms human macrophage metabolism remain incompletely defined. Tuberculous pleural effusion (TB-PE), a common extrapulmonary manifestation that frequently coexists with pulmonary TB, offers a unique, clinically relevant immunometabolic window into the TB microenvironment. Here, using patient-derived TB-PE samples, we demonstrate that this microenvironment induces a metabolic state in human macrophages that compromises their antimicrobial function. Lipidomic analysis identified an enrichment of the specialized pro-resolving mediator Resolvin D5 (RvD5), which signals through GPR32 to suppress macrophage microbicidal activity. The acellular fraction of TPE was sufficient to induce RvD5 secretion by monocytes, correlating with increased expression of RvD5 biosynthetic enzymes in pleural monocytes from TB patients. Mechanistically, RvD5-GPR32 signaling inhibited glycolysis without promoting oxidative phosphorylation, reducing HIF-1 activity and impairing intracellular M. tuberculosis control. HIF-1 stabilization restored antimicrobial function. These findings uncover the RvD5-GPR32-HIF-1 axis as a mechanism of metabolic immune suppression and a potential target for host-directed TB therapy.",

    "summary": "The human Y chromosome enables detailed reconstruction of paternal lineages through haplogroup classification. Existing tools for this purpose typically rely on outdated phylogenies, lack ancient DNA handling, or provide limited confidence metrics. Here I present yallHap, a Y-chromosome haplogroup classifier that integrates the YFull phylogenetic tree (185,780 SNPs) with probabilistic scoring, built-in ancient DNA damage filtering, and parallel processing for population-scale studies. Validation on 1,231 high-coverage gnomAD samples achieved 99.9% accuracy (95% CI: 99.5-100%) on GRCh38, and 1,233 samples from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 achieved 99.8% accuracy (95% CI: 99.3-100%). For ancient DNA with moderate variant density (4-10%), Bayesian ancient mode achieves +19.3 pp improvement over heuristic mode (+12 to +24 pp at 1% increments; see Supplementary Table S3), reaching 60-86% accuracy. On full AADR ancient DNA validation (7,333 samples spanning ~45,000 years), this translates to 90.7% overall accuracy (95% CI: 90.0-91.3%) versus 88.3% for heuristic transversions-only mode. At variant densities [&ge;]10%, both modes reach 97-99% accuracy. yallHap supports multiple reference genomes (GRCh37, GRCh38, T2T-CHM13v2.0), provides detailed quality metrics including optional ISOGG nomenclature output, and offers multi-threaded batch processing for large-scale studies. The tool is designed for integration into modern bioinformatics pipelines, with example wrappers for nf-core/eager [16,17] and Snakemake [18] workflows. The software is open source, available at https://github.com/trianglegrrl/yallHap, and distributed via pip, Bioconda, and Docker.",

The choroid plexus (ChP) is a blood-brain interface that produces CSF and forms the blood-CSF barrier. However, how ChP pathology develops across the lifespan and contributes to AD has not been systematically characterized. Here, we report a multi-modal ChP atlas integrating single-nucleus transcriptomics from 49 individuals, AI-assisted quantitative histopathology across >500 postmortem samples age 16 to 105, spatial transcriptomics, and functional studies in 5xFAD mice. We identify fibrosis, calcification, and macrophage abnormalities as hallmarks of ChP aging, with AD pathology conferring additional effects, including expansion of a pro-inflammatory fibroblast-macrophage signaling niche. In 5xFAD mice, macrophage dysfunction is associated with impaired epithelial barrier maintenance and repair. Together, these data provide a foundational resource for understanding ChP dysfunction in aging and AD and propose the macrophage-fibroblast-epithelial barrier axis as a driver of ChP pathology.",

    "summary": "Cold exposure of mice is associated with adaptive molecular and organellar changes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) that promote thermogenesis to defend body temperature. We previously reported that the lipid droplet protein Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) robustly increases in BAT during acute exposure of mice to cold. We demonstrated that chronic induction of BAT PLIN5 within the physiological range in mice housed at room temperature mimics the effects of cold exposure in terms of increased thermogenic gene expression in BAT, increased BAT mitochondria cristae packing, and increased uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, BAT PLIN5 overexpression led to healthy remodeling of inguinal white adipose tissue with improved systemic glucose tolerance and reduced diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Conversely, PLIN5 constitutive deletion in brown adipose tissue resulted in decreased BAT thermogenic gene expression and in BAT mitochondrial dysfunction but did not lead to cold intolerance or changes in glucose tolerance. We hypothesized that preserved cold tolerance despite chronic deficiency of PLIN5 in BAT was the result of compensatory white adipose tissue (WAT) beiging, as suggested by the observed increase in thermogenic gene expression in inguinal WAT (iWAT). To test this hypothesis, we developed a mouse model of doxycycline-inducible, acute deficiency of PLIN5 in BAT of adult mice (BiKOPLIN5 mice). After 7 days of doxycycline treatment and housing at 6 C, PLIN5 was significantly reduced in the BAT of BiKOPLIN5 mice compared with littermate control mice but was unchanged in the iWAT of these experimental groups. Under these conditions, thermogenic gene expression was reduced significantly in the BAT of BiKOPLIN5 mice compared to Control mice, as were mitochondrial cristae density and uncoupled BAT mitochondrial respiration. These effects of acute PLIN5 deficiency in BAT were associated with cold intolerance, which was consistent with the observed failure in iWAT of thermogenic gene expression to increase beyond that of Controls. These findings clarify the essential role of BAT PLIN5 in the physiological adaptive responses of mice to cold ambient temperature.",

    "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy, in part due to its rapid progression and early metastasis. To uncover novel drivers of this aggressive behavior, we first analyzed Frizzled receptor expression in human PDAC datasets and identified Frizzled 6 (FZD6) as uniquely predictive of poor clinical outcomes among all ten Frizzled family members. High FZD6 expression correlated with significantly worse overall survival for PDAC patients of any age. Functional studies in human PDAC cell lines showed that FZD6 promotes mesenchymal phenotypes, including enhanced migration and growth in 3D culture, while FZD6 loss induces E-cadherin expression and impairs motility without affecting 2D proliferation. In vivo, conditional epithelial deletion of Fzd6 in KPC mice significantly extended survival, reduced tumor burden and metastasis, and remodeled the tumor microenvironment to suppress stromal activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human and mouse PDAC tumors confirms that FZD6 is primarily found within the tumor cells and FZD6-activating, noncanonical Wnt ligands are found to be produced by the cancer-associated fibroblasts surrounding the tumors. Mechanistically, we found that FZD6 is a transcriptional target of specificity protein 1 (SP1), a factor upregulated in mutant p53 contexts and within basal-like PDAC subtypes. SP1 knockdown reduced FZD6 expression and signaling through the PCP pathway. Furthermore, reduced SP1 impaired cell motility. Together this implicates the SP1-Fzd6-Wnt/PCP axis as a key driver of epithelial plasticity and disease progression. These findings suggest that FZD6 is a central effector of mutant p53-driven EMT, and a promising therapeutic target in metastatic PDAC.",

    "summary": "In most eukaryotes, the enzyme telomerase maintains the termini of linear chromosomes through the addition of repetitive telomeric sequences. It is widely assumed that the primary site of action for telomerase is the single-stranded G-rich overhang at the ends of linear chromosomes. We show here that a second substrate, created by spontaneous replication fork collapse during duplex telomeric DNA replication in wild type budding yeast, is elongated by telomerase at a much higher frequency (~50%) than fully replicated chromosome termini. Furthermore, as much as ~200 nucleotides can be added in a single cell division to these newly collapsed forks, indicating that spontaneous replication fork collapse and the subsequent response by telomerase is a major determinant of telomere length homeostasis. This challenges a long-standing model for telomere length regulation which posits a length-sensing mechanism that assesses individual telomeres to determine whether chromosome ends are in telomerase-extendible or telomerase-non-extendible states. We propose that these two states are instead structurally and temporally distinct substrates for telomerase, generated by two different processes (fork collapse vs. completion of DNA replication). We also show that replication fork collapse at telomeres is kept in check by a telomere-dedicated Cdc13/Stn1/Ten1 complex in collaboration with the canonical RPA complex, indicating that these two complexes bind single-stranded DNA exposed at the replication fork to facilitate replisome progression through duplex telomeric DNA. Although failures during DNA replication are often genotoxic events, this represents an opposing example in which fork collapse has been co-opted to promote genome stability.",

    "summary": "Cancer cells depend on glucose for biomass synthesis, cell proliferation, and drug resistance. Glucose transporter (GLUT) transcripts as well as proteins are upregulated in human lungs and other cancers and are negatively correlated with patient survival, particularly GLUT1 and GLUT3. Thus, inhibiting GLUT function has been an attractive anticancer strategy. We previously characterized WZB117 and DRB18, first- and second-generation pan-class I GLUT inhibitors, respectively. DRB18 strongly inhibits glucose transport mediated by GLUT1-4 in non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report DRB18 as a more stable and potent anticancer compound, compared to WZB117. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed in Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissue array to investigate GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein expression between normal, lower and higher stage LUAD patients. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to examine additive effect of GLUT3 to GLUT1 mediated prognosis in LUAD. Glucose uptake and resazurin dye-based proliferation assays were used to determine glucose uptake inhibitory and cell proliferation inhibitory against panel of human cancer cell lines A549, Panc1 and Hela. DRB18 potency was tested against the presence of extracellular nutrients glucose, glutamine and ATP. Synergism between DRB18 and clinically approved anticancer drugs was tested against cancer cells. DRB18 and advanced NSCLC drug Paclitaxel were tested for synergy in vitro and in vivo. GLUT1/3 combination exhibited higher hazard ratio than either GLUT1 and GLUT3 alone in many cancer types including LUAD. DRB18 reduced glucose uptake in NSCLC A549, pancreatic Panc1, and cervical Hela cancer cells with varied but strong anticancer potencies in the presence or absence of extracellular nutrients such as ATP and glucose. Combined with different clinical and pre-clinical anticancer compounds such as V9302, CB839, Sutent, Brigatinib, DRB18 significantly increased death of A549 and Panc1 cells. Noteworthy, DRB18 exhibited strong anticancer synergy with paclitaxel, an approved chemo drug for NSCLC, drastically reducing cancer cell proliferation in vitro and growth of A549 tumors grafted on the flank of nude mice without significant side effects, compared to single drug treatments. Mechanistically, DRB18 treatment with paclitaxel elevated the expression of Caspases 3 and 9, suggesting GLUT-inhibiting and apoptosis-inducing anticancer mechanisms of DRB18 with paclitaxel. Collectively, our results demonstrate anticancer efficacy of pan class-I GLUT inhibitor DRB18 in combination with paclitaxel, providing a potentially more efficacious therapeutic strategy for treating advanced NSCLC and other cancers.",

    "summary": "Mitochondrial diseases are a group of heterogeneous genetic disorders that exhibit striking tissue specificity. Neurological involvement is among the most consistent features, yet the mechanisms that determine why selective neuronal populations are particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial dysfunction remain poorly understood. Mutations in MTRFR, a mitochondrial ribosome rescue factor, cause a progressive neuromuscular phenotype, but no relevant disease model exists to explain its cell-type-specific pathology. Here, we established the first human iPSC-derived neuronal model of MTRFR loss and identified mechanisms driving differential vulnerability between cortical and motor neurons. Although knockdown led to comparable deficits in mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS across both subtypes, cortical neurons engaged adaptive programs, including dendritic mitochondrial remodeling and heat-shock response activation, that preserved survival. Motor neurons failed to mount these responses and instead displayed apoptotic and inflammatory priming. Pharmacological enhancement of stress adaptation rescued motor neuron survival, indicating that resilience is programmable. These findings provide the first mechanistic evidence that neuronal susceptibility to mitochondrial translation defects is defined by the capacity to activate mitochondrial and cytoprotective stress-response pathways.",

    "summary": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that can fragment or fuse to support different bioenergetic demands (e.g., glycolysis vs. oxidative phosphorylation) and distinct cell behaviors (e.g., mitosis or migration). While the role of mitochondrial dynamics in wound healing and metabolic disorders has received significant attention, the role of mitochondrial fission and fusion during normal embryonic development is less well understood -- in part due to the difficulty of studying such processes in vivo. Combined with the depth-resolved imaging capabilities of multiphoton microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of the mitochondrial cofactor NADH can be used to simultaneously visualize mitochondrial network morphology and infer certain aspects of cellular bioenergetics (e.g., glycolysis vs. oxidative phosphorylation) in a label-free, non-invasive manner. Here we demonstrate that NADH FLIM can be used to accurately track the subcellular localization and topology of mitochondrial networks in live Drosophila embryos. We used this technique to assess whether cells show changes in NADH lifetime during convergent extension (CE) -- a conserved process of tissue remodeling in which thousands of germband cells undergo coordinated intercalation to drive elongation of the head-to-tail axis. Contrary to our expectations, we did not observe significant changes in NADH lifetime or network appearance during CE in wild-type embryos, suggesting that germband cells do not need to alter their baseline metabolism to fuel cell intercalation during normal development. To directly assess the role of mitochondrial fission and fusion during CE, we used RNA interference to disrupt the fission mediator Drp1 and the fusion mediator Opa1. Consistent with expectations, inhibiting mitochondrial fission in Drp1-knockdown embryos led to hyper-fused networks and significantly longer NADH lifetimes, indicating a shift towards oxidative phosphorylation. Conversely, inhibiting mitochondrial fusion in Opa1-knockdown embryos led to more hyper-fragmented networks and significantly shorter NADH lifetimes, indicating a shift towards glycolysis. Interestingly, inhibiting either fission or fusion altered tissue elongation and greatly increased the rate of cell intercalation errors, suggesting that a precise network topology is required for proper CE. We hypothesize that the CE defects in Drp1-knockdown embryos are primarily due to incorrect basal subcellular localization of mitochondria, whereas the CE defects in Opa1-knockdown embryos are due to deficient ATP and/or ROS production. These experiments demonstrate the utility of FLIM-based applications for characterizing the role of mitochondria during normal embryonic development, which could yield a better understanding of the metabolic underpinnings of various pathologies that involve epithelial remodeling, including spina bifida, defective wound healing, and cancer metastasis.",

These assemblies reveal novel chromosomal structures validated through cytogenetics, Hi-C, optical mapping, and synteny analyses with other palm genomes. Chromosome names were revised based on average lengths across all sequenced genomes. The Sex Determination Region (SDR) on chromosome 14 was confirmed through male-specific k-mer analysis, spanning approximately 14.7 Mb. Nucleolar organizing regions (NORs) were localized on chromosome 10, where a large 45S rDNA locus displayed unique repeat spacer motifs containing transposon-like sequences. In some accessions, a second NOR was identified on the female sex chromosome. This collection of date palm assemblies, anchored by the Ajwa reference genome, provides a critical resource for advancing breeding strategies aimed at enhancing the genetic resilience and productivity of date palm.",

    "summary": "Prolonged three-dimensional culture exposes stem cells to sustained microenvironmental and mechanical stresses that can promote aging and senescence-associated phenotypic alterations. This study examined how long-term expansion of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in a hollow fiber bioreactor (HFB) influences cellular senescence and the molecular composition of secreted small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). During extended HFB culture, BMSCs exhibited progressive morphological flattening and cytoskeletal disorganization, accompanied by increased senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase activity and immunophenotypic remodeling characterized by reduced fluorescence intensity and spatial redistribution of canonical MSC markers, consistent with a stress-adapted, early senescence-associated cellular state. In parallel, sEVs were collected longitudinally over 40 days and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis, immunoblotting, and quantitative proteomics. While vesicle size, marker expression, and yield remained stable throughout culture, proteomic profiling revealed pronounced, phase-dependent remodeling of sEV cargo, including coordinated alterations in oxidative stress-related processes, lysosomal and extracellular matrix-associated pathways, and relative depletion of cytoskeletal and translational components. Notably, these vesicular signatures closely mirrored senescence-associated changes observed at the cellular level. The strong correspondence between cellular phenotypes and sEV proteomic profiles establishes vesicle analysis as a convergent and noninvasive readout of BMSC aging, enabling sensitive monitoring of senescence progression while reducing reliance on parallel, labor-intensive cellular assays. Collectively, these findings indicate that prolonged HFB culture promotes a controlled, stress-associated senescence program in BMSCs and position sEV proteomic profiling as a robust approach for assessing stem cell aging dynamics during long-term three-dimensional bioreactor culture",

    "summary": "Alternative splicing is a key gene regulatory process that diversifies the proteome and controls gene dosage. Previous studies have detected aging-associated splicing changes across various tissues. However, their use of bulk RNA-seq obfuscates the impacted cell-types and may confound cell-type proportion changes with cell-intrinsic ones. We present a framework that first assembles and maps alternative splicing events in appropriate single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq), then applies LeafletFA, a probabilistic model that discovers coordinated splicing programs (SPs) without requiring prior knowledge of cell types or clinical information, such as age. Applying this framework to over 200,000 cells from mouse and human Smart-seq2 multi-tissue atlases, we discovered global and cell type specific aging-associated SPs. In mice, integrating SPs with gene expression significantly improved age prediction in 46 of 76 tissue-cell types tested. We identified the RNA-binding protein \\textit{Snrnp70} as a key upstream mediator driving the shift from youthful to aged SPs. To test evolutionary conservation of these patterns, we employed transfer learning to map the murine splicing dictionary onto human transcriptomes. This revealed a conserved \"youth\" program (SP4) that is maintained in quiescent endothelial tissues but lost in high-turnover organs. We identified a conserved, age-dependent alternative 5' splice site usage in the splicing factor \\textit{SRSF5} as a molecular marker of this program in both species. Our work establishes alternative splicing as a coordinated, evolutionarily conserved dimension of cellular aging and provides LeafletFA as an open-source tool for single-cell splicing analysis.",

    "summary": "Body homeostasis relies on accurate communication between the brain and the periphery. Disruption of this communication can contribute to disease. Tanycytes are located at the interface of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), bloodstream, and hypothalamus, where they sense circulating nutrients and regulate neuroendocrine axes and metabolism. However, the mechanisms by which they sense CSF signals remain largely unclear. Recent evidence that tanycytes possess primary cilia -- key sensory organelles -- led us to hypothesize that tanycytic cilia function as sensory antennae that detect metabolic cues in the CSF. Here, we demonstrate that tanycytic cilia exhibit distinct morphologies across subtypes and physiological states. They respond dynamically to hormonal and nutrient availability; notably, excess oleic acid shortens cilia, promotes lipid droplet accumulation, and reduces Ca2+ responses to ATP and glucose. Disrupting cilia via knockdown of intraflagellar transport (IFT) genes produced similar defects and impaired autophagy. Finally, selective Ift88 knockout in tanycytes increased body weight and reduced thermogenic activity in female mice. These findings identify tanycytic cilia as key sensors regulating energy balance.",

    "summary": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked dozens of genetic loci to type 1 diabetes (T1D). The IFIH1 gene, which encodes the double-stranded RNA sensor MDA5, is one such locus. The E627* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFIH1 is associated with protection against T1D, while the A946T variant is linked to increased risk. While the E627* variant has been shown to result in a truncated protein and dampen type I interferon (IFN) signaling, its specific role in human pancreatic islet health and function remains unclear. We hypothesized that MDA5627* would protect islet cells from stress-induced dysfunction, identity loss, and cell death. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we introduced the E627* and A946T variants into human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived from a T1D patient. We differentiated these hPSCs into stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) and treated them with IFN, poly(I:C), and coxsackievirus B3, an enterovirus implicated in T1D pathogenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and an array of functional assays, we investigated the variant impact on both whole SC-islets and their individual cell populations. Our analysis revealed that SC-islets, and their {beta}, , and {delta} cell subpopulations, harboring the MDA5627* variant exhibit an attenuated immune response to the various stressors compared to MDA5946T cells. We also report unique, cell-type-specific transcriptional responses that vary across variants. Notably, MDA5627* SC-islets showed reduced apoptosis rates and viral genome expression, as well as attenuated negative effects on mitochondrial function and insulin secretion in response to stress. Overall, our findings demonstrate that a clinically relevant MDA5 variant confers protection by dampening stress-mediated transcriptional responses, reducing cell dysfunction, and preventing apoptosis. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for understanding T1D pathogenesis and offer new avenues for developing preventative therapies.",

Prior research has found differences in positive selection, gene family evolution and gene functional loss linked with diet, but has focused primarily on trophic level classifications of herbivory, carnivory, and omnivory. Here we divide \"carnivores\" into vertivores and invertivores, due to the differences in nutrient composition of those food sources. We find significant differences in evolutionary conservation of multiple genes and GO categories between vertivores and invertivores. Conservation relative to herbivores differs among vertivores, invertivores, and the combination of all carnivores. Lineages with predatory diets have increased conservation in lipid and amino acid metabolism relative to herbivores. Notably, we find that results in the combined carnivore-herbivore comparison are much more similar to those of the invertivore-herbivore comparison than the vertivore-herbivore comparison, which suggests that prior studies on carnivory may have been detecting signatures of selection related to invertivory.",

Metabolic reprogramming has emerged as a key driver of therapy resistance, allowing tumor cells to adapt to environmental and therapeutic pressures. Here, we identify the maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) as a critical mediator of resistance in melanoma. We demonstrate that MELK stimulates intracellular accumulation of amino acids, leading to activation of mTORC1 signaling and enhanced mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis. This metabolic shift promotes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Importantly, preclinical MELK inhibition sensitizes resistant melanoma cells to immunotherapy, revealing a potential combinatorial strategy to overcome resistance. Our findings establish MELK as a central regulator of metabolic adaptation and therapeutic resistance in melanoma, highlighting its potential as a promising therapeutic target.",

    "summary": "Cells make hard calls under noise. When signaling is abnormal, those calls can go wrong and drive pathological conditions and diseases. In this research, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP) detection-theory framework that maximizes probability of detection (PD) for a chosen false alarm probability (PFA), without requiring prior probabilities, using experimental single-cell measurements of NF-{kappa}B responses to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a critical pathway involved in cell survival, apoptosis, immune signaling, and stress response, in wild-type and A20-deficient fibroblasts. We model log-responses as (multi)variate Gaussian and compute optimal thresholds, PD-PFA trade-offs, and ROC curves at 30 minutes and 4 hours. The NP framework captures expected biology: PD increases with TNF dose; wild-type cells outperform A20-/- at matched conditions; and combining two time points (bivariate analysis) improves detection (e.g., for 0.0052 vs. 0.2 ng/mL, PD rises from 0.71 (30 minutes) and 0.42 (4 hours) to 0.80 at PFA = 0.1). The analysis recovers expected biology (higher TNF causes higher detectability; negative feedback lowers late responses) and flags cases where decision quality degrades (e.g., perturbations that blunt separation between conditions). The same recipe extends to multivariate readouts without changing the logic. Overall, the NP detection framework provides a compact, quantitative score of pathway performance and failure. It turns noisy single-cell readouts into actionable decision metrics that compare doses, time points, and perturbations, and ultimately, can help explain when and how cellular decisions drift toward pathology.",

The subcellular degradation and recycling pathway known as autophagy is involved in many plant developmental processes including vegetative growth, reproductive development, seed development, and senescence. Here, we demonstrate that maize autophagy-defective atg10 mutants have delayed flowering and reduced kernel size, weight and number, leading to reduced grain yield. Reciprocal crosses between mutant and parental lines indicate that the maternal plant is the major contributor to the kernel phenotype in atg10 mutants, rather than the seed genotype. We hypothesize that this may be due to detrimental effects on nutrient remobilization from maternal tissue to seeds during kernel development, leading to reduced yield.",

    "summary": "We introduce a unified framework for analysing molecular reactivity based on a geometric, quantum-inspired environment representation and a fully deterministic, metal-aware implementation. Proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes are treated as configurations in 3D space with an abstract condition axis (R^3 x T), and each residue or nucleotide p is mapped to an environment vector Ep that encodes a coarse-grained, DFT-inspired density surrogate together with metal and phosphate fields, solvent exposure, and local geometry. A block-streamed, GPU-optional Python pipeline maps arbitrary PDB or mmCIF structures to fixed-dimensional environment vectors without stochastic training and scales to supramolecular assemblies: the 6Q97 tmRNA-SmpB-ribosome rescue complex (11,618 residues) can be processed in a single pass on commodity cloud hardware, demonstrating practical feasibility at ribosome scale. In a strict unbound, zero-shot setting on the Docking Benchmark 5.5 (DB5.5), a simple classifier trained on top of Ep achieves a macro-averaged area under the precision-recall curve of approximately 0.53 and a ROC AUC of approximately 0.86 for residue-level interface versus non-interface classification, competitive with specialised interface-prediction architectures despite using no evolutionary profiles, multiple sequence alignments, or task-specific retraining on DB5.5. Across mechanistically curated case studies (Rubisco, GroEL/GroES, SecA, p53-DNA, and ribosomal pockets), untuned random forests used purely as probes under site-grouped cross-validation yield ROC AUC values exceeding 0.95 for catalytic and anchor cores (for example SecA ATPase and the GroES IVL anchor), while diffuse regulatory and fitness-defined labels are substantially harder to separate. For 6Q97, a Tier 1 and Tier 2 labelling scheme over tmRNA and SmpB pockets, decoding-centre rRNA, the 23S peptidyl transferase centre, and helicase-like uS3, uS4, and uS5 pockets, together with a curated hard-negative panel of 323 buried hydrophobic, electrostatic, and stacking decoys, yields global AUCs of approximately 0.94 (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 versus all) and approximately 0.98 (Tier 1 plus Tier 2 versus hard negatives). These results support the view that the environment representation defines an interpretable \"reactivity manifold\" in which genuinely functional pockets occupy regions that cannot be mimicked by generic dense or charged environments, and that this structure remains accessible even for full ribosomes on modest hardware.",

Here, we succeeded in generating both positively and negatively charged NBs, achieving high zeta potentials in human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cell (NPC) and neuron culture media (pH 7.4). Similar to their bactericidal effects, NBs induced cell death in iPSC-derived cells, with positively charged NBs showing stronger cytotoxicity than negatively charged ones. This may be because the cell membrane carries a negative charge, making positively charged NBs more likely to approach and interact with the membrane, or because positively charged nanobubbles exhibit stronger radical generation. In future, we aim to elucidate the molecular biological mechanisms underlying NB-induced cell death and to contribute to the potential application of nanobubbles in regenerative medicine. This study will serve as an initial step toward that goal.",

    "summary": "The repeated transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments (terrestrialization) has shaped the evolutionary trajectory of many animal lineages, yet the genomic basis of this ecological shift remains incompletely understood. Arthropods, with multiple independent terrestrialization events, provide a powerful system to investigate whether parallel genomic changes underlie adaptation to land. Here, we present a phylum-wide comparative phylogenomic analysis of 309 arthropod species representing aquatic and terrestrial lineages, using gene family evolutionary dynamics and directional selection analyses to uncover shared genomic strategies associated with life on land. We identified thousands of orthogroups showing parallel expansions or contractions across the three main lineages that colonized land (Arachnida, Myriapoda, and Hexapoda), of which a significant proportion also exhibited lineage-specific shifts in selective pressure. Functional enrichment of these orthogroups revealed functional convergence on processes such as oxidative stress response, transmembrane transport, energy metabolism, exoskeleton formation, and moulting regulation. Notably, parallel evolution in aquaporins, solute carriers, cytochrome P450s, superoxide dismutases, and heat shock proteins suggests that a conserved terrestrialization toolkit underlies independent colonization events. Additionally, parallel remodeling of key developmental and immune signaling pathways highlights the role of regulatory and structural innovations in adapting to terrestrial challenges. Our results provide the first large-scale genomic evidence of parallel molecular evolution driving arthropod terrestrialization and emphasize the power of comparative genomics to reveal shared solutions to ecological transitions across deep evolutionary timescales.",

Our previous work has shown that targeting aging pathways can be neuroprotective in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. Based on these findings, we believe that by gaining insight into the aging process, that knowledge can be applied to identify novel therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease. To advance our understanding of aging, we used a genomics approach to identify genes regulated by multiple lifespan-extending pathways. We performed RNA sequencing on nine long-lived C. elegans mutants representing seven longevity pathways: insulin/IGF-1 signaling, dietary restriction, germline deficiency, impaired chemosensation, reduced translation, elevated mitochondrial ROS, and mild mitochondrial impairment. We found that most pairs of long-lived mutants exhibited a significant overlap in differentially expressed genes. Comparing gene expression across the entire panel of long-lived mutants revealed three distinct longevity groups that could be clearly distinguished by gene expression. Interestingly, two of these groups showed modulation of specific genetic pathways in opposite directions, suggesting that there are multiple alternative strategies to achieving long life. Filtering for genes similarly modulated in at least six mutants identified 196 upregulated and 62 downregulated aging genes. Upregulated genes were enriched in immunity, defense and metabolism, while many downregulated genes impacted translation and gene expression. To assess the ability of these genes to enhance longevity individually, we knocked down the commonly upregulated genes in long-lived mutants and evaluated the resulting effect on lifespan. Using this approach, we identified several genes that affect lifespan individually. Upregulation of at least some of these genes was sufficient to enhance stress resistance and extend lifespan in wild-type worms. Overall, the shared longevity genes identified in this work offer potential targets to promote healthy aging and decrease age-onset disease.",

    "summary": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worsens stroke outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms linking T2DM to systemic immune dysfunction remain unclear. We investigated whether T2DM alters bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis and dysregulate immune signaling following ischemic stroke in mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing, GeoMx digital spatial profiling (DSP), nCounter, and flow cytometry were used to analyze BM cells from control (db/+, Ctrl) and diabetic (db/db, T2DM) mice underwent experimental stroke or sham surgery. Diabetes caused marked structural remodeling of BM, with reduced cellularity and imbalance of hematopoietic lineages. Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed impaired differentiation and maturation signatures of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and granulocytes, and overactivation toward monocytes in diabetes after stroke. CellChat analysis demonstrated reorganization of intercellular communication, with hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC1) and monocytes emerging as dominant signaling hubs through upregulated MIF, SIRP, and THBS pathways. AUCell enrichment indicated increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation but reduced interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, reflecting metabolic activation coupled with immune dysregulation. DSP and nCounter further confirmed upregulation of genes in the MIF, SIRP and THBS pathways in CD115 monocytes and Ly6G neutrophils, indicating proinflammatory and migratory activation in diabetic bone marrow. Our data suggest that T2DM reprograms hematopoiesis and signaling networks, leading to maladaptive myeloid responses and impaired immune regulation after stroke. This maladaptive BM environment amplifies inflammation and limits repair, linking diabetic metabolic stress to worsened ischemic outcomes. Targeting bone marrow immune dysfunction may offer a therapeutic strategy to improve stroke recovery in diabetic patients.",

    "summary": "Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA-1) is essential for viral episome maintenance and is consistently expressed in all forms of EBV latency. In a previous study, we observed EBNA 1 localizing in the nucleolus, as well as its interaction with the nucleolar protein EBP2 in both the nucleoplasm and nucleoli. Nucleoli are dynamic nuclear domains that coordinate ribosome assembly with the regulation of cell cycle progression and stress responses. Here, we studied the mechanism by which EBNA-1 achieves nucleolar localization and functional consequences for host cell physiology. We observed that EBNA-1 nucleolar accumulation occurs specifically during late G1 and S phase and depends on a bipartite nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) composed of two cooperative Weber motifs separated by 24 amino acids. Mutations disrupting NoLS abolish interaction with the nucleolar protein EBP2, whose depletion similarly prevents EBNA-1 nucleolar import. Once in the nucleolus, EBNA1 triggers a 50 % reduction in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) which leads to a global reduction in cellular protein production. In addition, EBNA1 nucleolar targeting induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and antioxidant treatment restores both rRNA transcription and protein synthesis. These findings identify EBP2 as a viral nucleolar docking partner and establish nucleolar targeting of EBNA1 as a regulated, cell cycle-dependent process that links oxidative stress to the perturbation of ribosome biogenesis. This mechanism may contribute to the ability of EBNA-1 to promote cell survival and transformation.",

Dysfunction of this system is a driver of human disease and a hallmark of aging and late-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms that ensure robust protein turnover may provide new avenues for treatment in these contexts. E3 ubiquitin ligases play critical roles in supplying ubiquitinated substrates to the proteasome, with HUWE1 being an enormous, versatile, and highly conserved member of this family. Here, we show that the C. elegans HUWE1 ortholog, EEL-1, contributes to robust protein turnover during challenges to the proteolytic capacity of the proteasome. We demonstrate that the ability of EEL-1/HUWE1 to safeguard protein turnover requires ubiquitin-binding domains within the substrate-binding arena and the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase activity, supporting a model in which EEL-1 ensures degradation by increasing ubiquitination of pre-ubiquitinated substrates. EEL-1 contains extensive lysine-deficient regions, found at conserved locations in its substrate-binding arena. Through unbiased mutagenesis screening and precise engineering of the EEL-1 protein, we uncover that introducing lysine residues into these regions is detrimental to UPS function. Together, our findings indicate a central and evolutionarily ancient role for EEL-1/HUWE1 in maintaining optimal UPS function and support targeting this E3 for therapeutic manipulation.",

    "summary": "Z-DNA/Z-RNA is an alternative left-handed nucleic acid conformation with established and emerging roles in gene regulation, immunity, and genome instability. However, its occurrence dynamics and lineage specificity across the tree of life have not yet been fully characterized. Utilizing the recently developed and improved Z-DNA searching tool, ZSeeker, we analyzed 281,139 complete organismal genomes, including multiple Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies, and generated genome-wide Z-nucleic acid maps, examined their topography, and compared them to dinucleotide-preserving controls. Cellular genomes featured pervasive Z-DNA enrichment relative to expectation, with enrichments of ~1.5 and ~1.7-fold in Bacteria and Archaea and ~3-fold in Eukaryota. In contrast, Viruses exhibited large differences between lineages, with modest enrichment in several DNA viral groups and pronounced depletion across RNA clades, most notably Influenza A/B strains. We built a LASSO regression model trained on non-Influenza viruses (cross-validated R2 {approx} 0.73), which identified GC content, genome type, and host type as the leading predictors for Z-nucleic acid density, yet it significantly over-predicted Z-RNA density in Influenza A/B. More than 99% of assemblies exceeded the +2 SD threshold, and a \"typical Influenza\" genome was predicted at 2.76 bp/kb compared to ~0.016 bp/kb observed (a ~170-fold overestimation based on chance alone). Together, these results reveal domain- and lineage-specific regimes: cellular genomes are enriched for Z-DNA consistent with regulatory roles, whereas influenza viruses appear to have undergone strong, lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming sequences, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure tied to host sensing pathways.",

    "summary": "Cyclin C is a highly conserved component of the Mediator kinase module that regulates transcription through CDK8 stimulation. In addition, the yeast (Cnc1) and human (CCNC) cyclin C exhibit stress-induced mitochondrial translocation to stimulate fission through direct interaction with the dynamin-like GTPase DRP1 (mammals) or Dnm1 (yeast). Gene ablation studies revealed that both Cnc1 and CCNC are required for cell damage-induced regulated cell death (RCD). To determine the relative contributions of cyclin Cs transcriptional and mitochondrial roles in promoting RCD, this study utilized docking simulation algorithms to predict interaction interfaces for CCNC-CDK8 and CCNC-DRP1 heterodimers. As expected, CCNC bound CDK8 through its amino terminal cyclin box domain while DRP1 associated with the second carboxyl cyclin box. Using these predictions, we used site directed mutagenesis on Cnc1 to separate these functions. Importantly, only the DRP1/Dnm1-interaction residues were important for RCD in yeast. Interestingly, although Dnm1 is required for RCD, its fission activity was not. Moreover, Dnm1 is still required for RCD even when Cnc1 is targeted to the mitochondria indicating it is not simply functioning as a tether. Finally, when expressed in yeast, the human CCNC efficiently induced fission and stimulated RCD. Moreover, these functions required predicted DRP1 interaction sites as well. In conclusion, these studies revealed that cyclin C separates its nuclear and mitochondrial activities by utilizing different cyclin box domains. Second, Dnm1-cyclin C interaction, and not transcriptional control, is critical for cyclin C-dependent RCD and this role is conserved from yeast to humans.",

    "summary": "The chromosomal mechanisms responsible for the extraordinary diversity in chromosome number and karyotype structure in Paphiopedilum remain incompletely resolved, particularly the processes by which extensive dysploid variation has arisen in the apparent absence of polyploidy. Telomeric repeats provide informative cytogenetic markers for reconstructing chromosome evolution because their typically terminal localization and repetitive nature can retain signatures of breakage, fusion, and repair. To address the chromosomal evolutionary problem in Paphiopedilum, telomeric repeat distribution was examined in 41 species representing all major taxonomic sections (phylogenetic lineages) using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In addition to conventional terminal telomeres, diverse interstitial telomeric repeat (ITR) patterns were detected, including centromeric, pericentromeric, and subtelomeric arrays, as well as rare chromosome ends lacking detectable telomeric signals. Classification of these patterns into twelve chromosomal types, interpreted in a phylogenetic context, suggests that telomere-associated and chromosome structural processes have contributed to karyotype diversification, including centric fission, subtelomeric rearrangement, repeat amplification, and potentially centric fusion, with different processes predominating among lineages. In some sections, such as Pardalopetalum, these types resolve into internally consistent patterns often dominated by terminal localization with recurrent subtelomeric expansion, providing a clear cytogenetic signature of lineage-specific telomere repeat dynamics, whereas other sections exhibit greater within-section heterogeneity in both signal position and intensity. These results provide a coherent cytogenetic framework for dysploid chromosome evolution in Paphiopedilum and identify telomeric repeat dynamics as an important contributor to karyotype diversification in the genus.",

    "summary": "The eIF4F translation initiation complex controls ERK MAPK signaling in malignant melanomas with BRAF and NRAS mutations. It also contributes to the development of melanoma resistance to therapies targeting BRAF and MEK kinases. Here, we uncovered a critical role for eIF4F in regulating the main cellular metabolic sensor, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In melanoma cells with the most common BRAF V600E mutation, ERK and AMPK pathway activities were reported as mutually exclusive. This is because BRAF -driven ERK activity negatively impacts LKB1-mediated canonical AMPK activation. However, we observed that eIF4F inhibition can stimulate AMPK activity in melanoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo, despite concomitant ERK hyperactivation. Notably, the protein levels of LKB1 and its co-factor MO25 were sensitive to eIF4F inhibition, indicating a non-canonical LKB1-independent mechanism of AMPK activation. In a proteomic screen, we aimed to identify eIF4F roles in melanoma cell physiology beyond the MAPK pathway. We found that the eIF4F function is essential for maintaining cellular levels of key cell cycle and metabolic regulators, including CDK1, CDK2, TYMS, and UHRF1. Importantly, we also identified the protein phosphatase PP2A as a new eIF4F target. Our subsequent analyses showed that inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown of PP2A increases AMPK activity in melanoma cells, independent of LKB1. This data shows that PP2A plays a significant role in regulating AMPK activity in melanoma. Thus, eIF4F inhibition not only impairs canonical AMPK activators but also downregulates PP2A, which negatively regulates AMPK dynamics. Collectively, our data highlight a dual role of eIF4F in the control of AMPK in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells. It maintains the canonical AMPK signaling pathway while simultaneously limiting the extent of AMPK activation via the eIF4F-PP2A-AMPK axis. Pharmacological inhibition of this axis can overcome the negative control of AMPK signaling by the ERK pathway. This suggests new therapeutic opportunities to disrupt melanoma growth.",

Basal NLRP3 expression was higher in astrocytes than in GBM cells and increased after LPS stimulation, altering astrocyte morphology and NLRP3 subcellular localization. siRNA-mediated silencing of NLRP3 reduced GBM proliferation, migration, and viability in GBM cells, while enhancing proliferation and cytokine secretion in astrocytes, highlighting its context-dependent effects. NLRP3 deficiency exhibited reciprocal cytokine paracrine signaling, with GBM cells releasing elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-, and astrocytes releasing elevated levels of IL-1{beta}. Glyburide treatment reduced NLRP3 expression and IL-1{beta} release in GBM cells but elevated NLRP3 and IL-1{beta} in astrocytes.

    "summary": "Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) mediate effector-triggered immunity (ETI), often accompanied by a hypersensitive response (HR). Conversely, extreme resistance (ER) provides exceptionally rapid and effective antiviral protection without visible cell death, yet the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying ER remain poorly defined. The TIR-NLR receptor Rysto recognizes the coat protein (CP) of potato virus Y (PVY) and can trigger either ER or HR depending on the context. Here, we demonstrate that the efficacy of Rysto-mediated ER relies on the orchestration of various defense mechanisms. These involve transcriptional priming, and spatial redistribution of the receptor and a subset of chaperones. Rysto-expressing lines exhibit a preactivated immune state, including increased expression of genes encoding glycine-rich proteins associated with the cell wall interface and thickness. Upon PVY infection, Rysto plants undergo rapid transcriptome reprogramming, including redox- and defense-related pathways. At the protein level, Rysto initially forms a pre-active complex with Hsp70 and CP-interacting cochaperonins (CPIPs) which is remodeled upon PVY CP binding. PVY CP competes for Hsp70, enabling Rysto to oligomerize into an active resistosome. This process is further accompanied by relocalization of a subpool of the receptor toward an interface of plasma membrane, cell wall. Our research reveals a chaperone-mediated activation mechanism and spatial immune repositioning that differentiate ER responses from traditional HR, offering a detailed system for achieving durable antiviral resistance in plants.",
