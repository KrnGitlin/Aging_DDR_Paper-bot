    "summary": "Research on progeria not only contributes to treatments for the disease but also enhances our understanding of physiological ageing. Mouse models of progeria recapitulate pathological ageing phenotypes seen in patients, including cardiovascular defects, increased cellular senescence, systemic inflammation, DNA damage accumulation, and shortened lifespan. In cultured cells from Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) patients, the human p53 isoform {Delta}133p53 was previously shown to inhibit p53-mediated cellular senescence, proinflammatory IL-6 production, and DNA damage accumulation, and to extend cellular replicative lifespan. Here we show that, in a heterozygous HGPS mouse model, transgenic expression of {Delta}133p53 reproduces these in vitro-observed effects across multiple organs in vivo and extends median lifespan by 11% (387 versus 349 days, P = 0.0379). In the aorta and skin, {Delta}133p53 abrogates progeria-characteristic pathological changes and preserves tissue integrity. Our data further suggest that {Delta}133p53 may promote a broad spectrum of ageing-counteracting mechanisms, including bone homeostasis, metabolic fitness, antioxidant defense, youthful epigenome, and tissue stemness. Together with the anti-inflammatory and tissue-preserving effects of {Delta}133p53 in naturally aged mice and its age-associated downregulation in human tissues, this study suggests that {Delta}133p53-based therapeutic strategies may be applicable not only to HGPS but also as broader interventions for preventing or delaying ageing.",

    "summary": "Successive maturation of ribosomal subunits occurs through multi-layered phase-separated structures of the cell nucleolus. The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5' ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.",

    "summary": "Background: Ubiquitin-dependent signaling is essential for maintaining intestinal homeostasis and its dysregulation contributes to chronic intestinal disorders, such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Ube4A is a U-box E3/E4 ubiquitin ligase involved in lipid metabolism and insulin signaling in metabolic tissues. Autoantibodies against Ube4A have been identified in patients with IBD and are associated with disease long-term complications. Despite these clinical associations, the physiological role of Ube4A in the gastrointestinal tract remains unknown. This study aimed to define the function of Ube4A in the colon and determine how its loss influences susceptibility to experimental colitis. Methods: UBE4A expression in human colonic tissue from healthy individuals and patients with IBD was analyzed using publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The role of Ube4A in colonic homeostasis and colitis pathogenesis was examined using global Ube4A knockout (UKO) mice subjected to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. UKO colon phenotypes were characterized using transcriptomic analyses, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Results: UBE4A is highly expressed in human colonic epithelial cells, and its expression is reduced from healthy to IBD inflamed tissues. In mice, Ube4A deficiency significantly exacerbated DSS-induced colitis, as evidenced by increased weight loss, disease activity scores, shortened colon length, and more severe histological injury. Transcriptomic profiling revealed enhanced inflammatory signaling, alongside dysregulation of lipid transport and storage, as well as antimicrobial defense pathways. DSS-treated UKO mice also exhibited increased mast cell activation and elevated expression of matrix metalloproteinases. Importantly, colons from UKO mice displayed baseline transcriptional alterations indicative of epithelial stress and disrupted lipid metabolic programs, even in the absence of injury. Conclusions: Ube4A is a previously unrecognized regulator of colon homeostasis. Its loss induces existing epithelial stress and metabolic reprogramming that sensitize the colon to exaggerated inflammatory responses during injury such as experimental colitis.",

    "summary": "Background: Chloroplasts play central roles not only in primary metabolism but also in the regulation of plant growth, development, and stress responses through complex signaling networks. AT4G33780 is annotated as a putative ATP phosphoribosyltransferase (ATP-PRT) regulatory subunit and predicted to localize to chloroplasts; however, its biological function in planta remains largely unexplored. How chloroplast-associated regulators coordinate developmental processes with metabolic status and stress adaptation is still poorly understood. Results: We characterized the function of AT4G33780 in Arabidopsis thaliana using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout and overexpression lines. AT4G33780 localized to chloroplasts and exhibited pronounced tissue-specific expression. Genetic perturbation of AT4G33780 resulted in non-linear and context-dependent developmental phenotypes, affecting seed germination, early seedling growth, vegetative development, and root responses to nickel stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming in knockout plants, including coordinated upregulation of cell wall-related gene families. Untargeted metabolomic profiling further indicated pronounced alterations in central energy metabolism, particularly pathways associated with carbon flux and energy utilization. Integrated omics analyses suggested that AT4G33780 does not directly control individual metabolic pathways but influences higher-order coordination between metabolic state and developmental regulation. Conclusions: Our results identify AT4G33780 as a chloroplast-localized regulator that modulates plant growth and stress-associated responses in a dosage- and context-dependent manner. Rather than acting as a simple determinant of growth, AT4G33780 contributes to developmental robustness by aligning energy utilization and cell wall remodeling with developmental demand. This study provides new insights into how chloroplast-associated regulatory factors integrate metabolism, development, and stress adaptation in plants.",

    "summary": "Chemoresistance remains a major obstacle to effective cancer treatment, often driven by enhanced DNA repair mechanisms that enable tumor cells to withstand genotoxic therapies. One such pathway involves the atypical DNA damage repair complex ALKBH3-ASCC, activated by the E3 ligase RNF113A in response to alkylation damage. We previously showed that SMYD3-dependent methylation of RNF113A stimulates this pathway, enhancing DNA repair and promoting resistance. Here, we identify KDM7B/PHF8 as the bona fide RNF113A demethylase, establishing one of the first functional examples of a dynamic, reversible non-histone methylation event regulating genome integrity. KDM7B antagonizes SMYD3 activity by maintaining low levels of methylated RNF113A, thereby limiting ASCC activation and sensitizing cancer cells to alkylating agents. To dissect this regulation in depth, we focused on small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a particularly aggressive malignancy characterized by limited therapeutic options and rapid acquisition of resistance. In SCLC, high KDM7B levels correlate with improved patient prognosis, whereas xenografts with reduced expression exhibit diminished responses to alkylating treatment. Moreover, CRISPR-based on/off modulation of KDM7B in genetically engineered SCLC mouse models demonstrates its central role in determining tumor response to chemotherapy. Our findings position the RNF113A-ASCC axis as a central modulator of chemoresistance, regulated through a post-translational methylation switch representing an innovative therapeutic vulnerability that could be exploited to enhance the efficacy of alkylating agents. Targeting this pathway may provide new opportunities to overcome chemoresistance, with KDM7B levels serving as a predictive biomarker to guide treatment in SCLC.",

    "summary": "Autophagy is a critical cellular process that maintains homeostasis and enables adaptation to metabolic stress. The selective autophagy receptor p62/SQSTM1 has been implicated in multiple aspects of autophagy regulation; however, its specific contribution to basal versus stress-induced autophagic flux remains incompletely defined, particularly in neuronal cells. In this study, we investigated the role of p62 in regulating basal and starvation-induced autophagy using a CRISPR Cas9 generated p62 knockout (p62 KO) neuroblastoma (N2a) cell model. Autophagic flux was quantified by measuring LC3 II accumulation in the presence and absence of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1. Under nutrient-replete conditions, basal autophagic flux was comparable between wild-type and p62-deficient cells, indicating that p62 is dispensable for constitutive autophagy. In contrast, starvation robustly increased autophagic flux in wild-type cells but failed to do so in p62 KO cells, demonstrating a requirement for p62 in starvation-induced autophagy. Consistent with a stress-responsive role, p62 protein levels increased during starvation in wild-type cells under lysosomal inhibition, reflecting enhanced p62 expression rather than impaired degradation. Together, these findings reveal a context-dependent function for p62 in neuronal autophagy, whereby p62 is essential for mounting an effective autophagic response to nutrient deprivation but is not required for basal autophagic turnover.",

    "summary": "Land-based spatial mazes are a low-stress method to evaluate learning in rodent models of dementia. By using innate exploratory and hiding behavior, the Barnes maze requires fewer trials, allowing examination of early learning rate and retention, as well as executive and motivational features that can be characteristic of non-amnestic dementias. However, unwanted odor cues may disrupt interpretation of acquisition rate during typical learning trials. We designed and tested our Barnes FIELD protocol (Find the Invisible Exit to Locate the Domicile) to improve reproducibility, allow evaluation of learning trials, and limit experimenter influence. The protocol uses 3D-printed escape shuttles and docking tunnels, allowing mice to exit the maze to the home cage. We show evidence that our shuttles mitigate the possibility of undesired cues. We demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol across several models of cognitive impairment and aging, and develop an additional stage, the STARR (Spatial Training And Rapid Reversal) maze, to better challenge behavioral flexibility. By examining commonly used outcome measures we identify important considerations for interpretation. These insights are used to evaluate several models of cognitive change, including deficits in an Alzheimers disease mouse model, and behavioral flexibility in a model of brainstem dysfunction. This work provides comprehensive instructions to build, perform, and analyze a robust spatial maze that expands the range of behavioral and motivational outcomes that can be identified and screened. Our findings will aid interpretation of traditional protocols, enhance rigor and reproducibility, and provide an updated method to screen for cognitive changes in mice.",

    "summary": "Oncogenic Ras is known to induce DNA replication stress, leading to cellular senescence or death. In contrast, we found that it can also trigger polyploid Drosophila ovarian nurse cells to die by inducing aberrant division stress. To explore intrinsic protective mechanisms against this specific form of cellular stress, here we conducted a genome-wide genetic screen and identified the E2 enzyme Uev1A as a key protector. Reducing its expression levels exacerbates the nurse cell death induced by oncogenic Ras, while overexpressing it or its human homologs, UBE2V1 and UBE2V2, mitigates this effect. Although Uev1A is primarily known for its non-proteolytic functions, our studies demonstrate that it collaborates with the E3 APC/C complex to mediate the proteasomal degradation of Cyclin A, a key cyclin that drives cell division. Furthermore, Uev1A and UBE2V1/2 also counteract oncogenic Ras-driven tumorigenesis in diploid cells, suppressing the overgrowth of germline tumors in Drosophila and human colorectal tumor xenografts in nude mice, respectively. Remarkably, elevated expression levels of UBE2V1/2 correlate with improved survival rates in human colorectal cancer patients harboring oncogenic KRAS mutations, indicating that their upregulation could represent a promising therapeutic strategy.",

    "summary": "Stable laminar flow maintains vascular tone regulation, while abnormal blood flow, such as disturbed flow or extreme shear stress, causes endothelial dysfunction, but the underlying mechanism is yet to be explored. We used a microfluidic device to deform flat microchannel into tunnel-like macrochannel. The cross-sectional area of this macrochannel varies with the flow rate and the thickness of the deformable layer, creating three levels of shear stress: low (0.99 dyn/cm^2, LSS), medium (4.78 dyn/cm^2, MSS), and high (24 dyn/cm^2, HSS). Comparing different shear stress exposure to endothelial cells for 24 h, prominent ferroptosis features emerged under either LSS or HSS compared to MSS. These features included increased C11 BODIPY-labeled lipid peroxidation and 4-hydroxynonenal accumulation, CoQ10 depletion, reduced SLC7A11 protein expression, and diminished cell death with Ferrostatin-1 treatment. RNA-seq analysis (LSS/MSS) showed that LSS significantly downregulated transcription of cholesterol homeostasis and unfolded protein response (UPR). Compared to MSS, Western blot results showed that both LSS and HSS reduced the expression of two key enzymes (MVD and IDI1) in the mevalonate pathway, as well as the expression of two main UPR signaling regulators (PERK and BiP). Based on the binding prediction between transcription factors and gene promoters from differentially expressed genes identified through RNA-seq, we found KLF6 to be a key transcription factor. It regulates the PERK-mediated UPR and the mevalonate pathway, which are associated with SLC7A11 expression and CoQ10 synthesis, respectively. The overexpression of KLF6 restored SLC7A11 and CoQ10 levels under both LSS and HSS, significantly reducing foam cell formation, monocyte adhesion, and lipid peroxidation. Our findings reveal KLF6 as a crucial regulator of atherosclerosis induced by abnormal shear stress.",

    "summary": "Endocytosis is an evolutionarily conserved process that enables neurons to internalize signaling receptors and membrane proteins, maintaining cellular homeostasis and supporting rapid responses to extracellular cues. The neuronal membrane-associated periodic skeleton (MPS), a lattice-like cytoskeletal structure composed of actin and spectrin, has been shown to restrict clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) at the axon initial segment (AIS) of neurons, by gating clathrin-coated pit (CCP) formation through membrane-localized \"clearing\" structures that are devoid of MPS. However, the extent to which the MPS regulates diverse forms of endocytosis across neuronal compartments, and how it is dynamically remodeled to permit trafficking on demand, remain unknown. While CME is relatively well characterized in neurons, the subcellular localization and physiological relevance of caveolin-mediated endocytosis, flotillin-mediated endocytosis, and fast endophilin-mediated endocytosis (FEME) have remained largely unclear. Here, we show that all four major endocytic pathways (CME, caveolin-, flotillin-, and FEME) are spatially gated by the MPS and occur specifically within MPS-free \"clearing\" zones distributed across both axonal and somatodendritic compartments of mature neurons. These results, for the first time, map the spatial landscape of these lesser-understood pathways in neurons and reveal a unifying principle of cytoskeletal gating across endocytic mechanisms. Disruption of the MPS markedly enhances both basal and ligand-induced endocytosis across all four pathways, establishing its broad inhibitory role in pit initiation. We further discover that endocytosis can, in turn, remodel the MPS through a novel signaling-driven feedback loop: ligand-triggered endocytosis activates ERK signaling, which promotes calpain- and caspase-mediated spectrin cleavage. This targeted cytoskeletal degradation facilitates further rounds of endocytosis, forming a self-reinforcing circuit that couples membrane trafficking with cortical architecture remodeling. Finally, we show that the MPS limits amyloid precursor protein (APP) endocytosis and thereby suppresses amyloid- {beta}1-42 (A{beta}42) production and neuronal apoptosis, implicating MPS integrity in the regulation of neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease. Together, our findings establish the MPS as a dynamic, signal-responsive modulator of endocytosis and neuronal health. This work uncovers a general spatial gating mechanism that applies to diverse endocytic pathways, introduces a cytoskeleton-centered feedback loop for signal-dependent remodeling, and expands the functional significance of the MPS from passive structural support to active regulation of neuronal homeostasis and disease susceptibility.",

Early developmental events including proliferation and cell differentiation in this dedicated seed sink structure are expected be responsive to the availability of photoassimilates and in turn to affect seed size and quality. However, the gene regulatory programs underlying early development of cereal endosperm remain largely unknown. We profiled the maize (Zea mays) endosperm transcriptome during the first four days after pollination using laser-capture microdissection and identified multiple temporal co-expression modules including a subset activated upon fertilization. Our analysis of the associated cis-regulatory elements and co-expressed transcription factor (TF) families enabled us to construct a gene network regulating basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) differentiation through MYB-related (MYBR) transcription factors and a network of E2F TFs for early endosperm proliferation. We found a significant association of the BETL network with kernel size variation and a contribution of the Glucose-target-of-rapamycin (TOR)-dependent processes to the E2F-mediated regulation of endosperm proliferation. Using the available data, we propose early proliferative development and transfer cell differentiation in endosperm are coordinated via sugar-sensing inputs to ultimately control seed size. Our analysis can guide the development of strategies for improvement of seed composition and yield.",

Since loss of the tumor suppressor APC is common in TNBC, we investigated how APC depletion alters transcriptional adaptation to chemotherapy using RNA-seq profiling of MDA-MB-157 cells and APC knockdown derivatives under control, cisplatin, and paclitaxel treatment. Pathway analyses of the transcriptomes showed that APC knockdown induces extensive remodeling of DNA-damage response, mitochondrial metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and chromatin accessibility, establishing stress-adapted transcriptional states aligned with paclitaxel tolerance (APC shRNA1) or cisplatin resilience (APC shRNA2). Machine-learning feature selection (Random Forest + PLS-DA) identified a 43-gene discriminant signature enriched for regulators of cell cycle and DNA repair (CCNB3, ORC1, E2F2, UNG), cytokine signaling (CXCL2, IL11), and metabolic support. These findings suggest that APC loss primes TNBC cells for chemotherapy persistence through an energetically reinforced, transcriptionally flexible survival program, highlighting DDR--OXPHOS--translation and inflammatory circuits as potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

We demonstrated that herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) induced selective degradation of class I histone deacetylases (HDAC1/2), leading to histone hyperacetylation and subsequent DDR activation. Strikingly, viral infection promoted nuclear export of HDAC1/2, followed by MDM2-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. Pharmacological inhibition of either DDR signaling or HDAC1/2 nuclear export significantly affected viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal a unique viral strategy to hijack host epigenetic regulation for efficient replication and identify potential therapeutic targets for alphaherpesvirus infections.",

    "summary": "Background: Essential hypertension, characterized by vascular dysfunction, remains a leading modifiable cause of death globally. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), which normally reduces vasoconstriction, becomes less anticontractile in hypertension due at least in part to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). Brown PVAT has emerged as a protective regulator of vascular tone. Follistatin, an activin antagonist, induces browning of peripheral adipose tissue depots via AMPK. We recently reported improved blood pressure, vascular function and reduced vascular ROS by follistatin in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model of essential hypertension. Here, we investigate whether follistatin reduces ROS and induces browning in SHR PVAT to restore PVAT function. Methods: SHR were treated with vehicle, follistatin or hydralazine for 8 weeks. Mesenteric white and thoracic brown PVAT from SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto were utilized, with wire myography used to assess vascular function. Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrite were measured in PVAT using DAF-2 FM fluorescence or Griess reagent, respectively. PVAT ROS and browning markers were assessed biochemically and via immunohistochemistry. PVAT was treated ex vivo for 3 days to assess mechanisms of browning. Unbiased proteomic analysis of PVAT was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: SHR PVAT dysfunction, manifest as a pro-contractile effect, was inhibited by follistatin through reducing ROS, enhancing NO bioavailability and inducing browning. Activin neutralization and AMPK phosphorylation mediated the beneficial effect of follistatin on SHR PVAT. Hydralazine-induced blood pressure reduction did not replicate follistatin effects, suggesting vascular benefits of follistatin are mediated by direct PVAT modulation. Proteomic analysis showed that follistatin shifts PVAT proteome towards normal state, upregulating processes associated with adipose tissue browning. Conclusion: Follistatin restores PVAT-mediated vascular relaxation via ROS reduction, activin neutralization and AMPK-dependent browning, positioning the potential for PVAT as a therapeutic target for vascular dysfunction in essential hypertension.",

    "summary": "The direct cognitive benefits of interventions targeting cognitive aging highly vary across individuals due to individual heterogeneity in aging-related comorbidities. This variation necessitates a better characterization of brain representations reflecting how older individuals uniquely benefit from interventions, thereby revealing the true effect of these interventions. Resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) has potential to uncover meaningful brain representation; however, traditional methods analyzing summary features derived from rsfMRI data are limited in capturing both within-individual variations across timepoints and between-individual difference, particularly in small and heterogeneous local intervention studies. Recent rsfMRI foundation models pretrained on large-scale observational cohorts, such ask UK Biobank, offer a potential alternative, yet their validity and generalizability in local intervention studies remain unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluated existing rsfMRI foundation models for classifying intervention responses to changes of episodic memory using data from two independent randomized controlled trials targeting cognitive aging among older adults with mild cognitive impairment. RsfMRI foundation models outperformed conventional machine learning and deep learning approaches, while performance differed across foundation models with different pretraining objectives. Clinically informed fine-tuning using an external Alzheimer's disease cohort further improved performance and demonstrated robustness to confounders (e.g., head motion during MRI data acquisition, data collection site, intervention arm). Interpretability analyses confirmed that brain representations learned by the model reflect the brain networks supporting cognitive aging or episodic memory. Together, these findings provide an empirical evaluation of current rsfMRI foundation models and support nuanced interpretation of heterogeneous intervention outcomes by linking individual differences in longitudinal brain dynamics to cognitive change.",

    "summary": "Background: The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 is the most common genetic cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and is associated with increased susceptibility to sporadic PD, which likely arises from the interplay of genetic predisposition, environmental exposure, and aging. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has been implicated as an independent risk factor for PD, but the potential interaction between the G2019S LRRK2 mutation and metabolic stress in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Methods: We employed long-term high-fat diet (HFD) feeding to induce metabolic syndrome in aged LRRK2 mutant mice, followed by system-wide characterization using multi-omic approaches, including metabolomic profiling, proteomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Results: We find that thymidine and deoxyuridine levels are consistently reduced across tissues in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice at baseline, accompanied by increased hepatic expression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP). HFD exposure further unmasks disruptions in purine and energy metabolism in the brain and lungs of G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice, with astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the ventral midbrain exhibiting the most pronounced impairment in oxidative phosphorylation transcriptional pathways. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that pre-existing metabolic syndrome unmasks widespread disruptions in systemic nucleotide and energy metabolism and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction in G2019S LRRK2 knockin mice. This conditional \"two-hit\" phenotype underscores the critical role of environmental factors, such as diet, in revealing metabolic vulnerabilities associated with PD-linked genetic backgrounds. Our study provides novel insight into potential metabolic targets or pathways for therapeutic intervention in individuals at-risk for developing PD.",

Here, we identify the preBotzinger complex (preBotC), a brainstem breathing rhythm generator, as a key stress-responsive hub coordinating metabolic adaptations. Using viral tracing, we show that preBotC neurons project to brown adipose tissue and liver, and that a subset of these projection neurons expresses the pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) receptor PAC1R, positioning PACAP signaling as a critical modulator of this circuit. Whole-brain c-Fos mapping revealed robust preBotC activation under stress, while spatial transcriptomics demonstrated altered neuronal metabolic circuitry in preBotC following PAC1R ablation. PAC1R knockdown in preBotC combined with stress resulted in blunted respiratory rhythmicity, reduced sympathetic innervation, and suppression of energy expenditure and lipid metabolic pathways in brown fat, while reprogramming hepatic transcriptional networks toward amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis. These findings define a unique neuropeptidergic brainstem periphery circuit integrating stress, respiration, and metabolism.",

    "summary": "Age is a risk factor for aortic aneurysm (AA), and different segments of the aorta exhibit varying susceptibilities to aneurysm. The specific factors that contribute to the higher incidence of AA and its complications with aging remain unclear. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are elevated in AA. However, the connection between aging, aortic MMP activity, and the increased prevalence of AA and its complications has not been systematically evaluated. This study leveraged MMP-targeted molecular imaging to investigate how aging affects aortic MMP expression and activity, as well as aneurysm development and survival. Methods: AA development and animal survival were monitored for 28 days after Angiotensin (Ang)-II infusion in 8-10-week-old (young) and >51-week-old (old) Apoe-/- mice. Aortic MMP activation was quantified by PET/CT using an MMP-targeted tracer, 64Cu-RYM2, at baseline and 1 week after Ang II infusion. MMP activity and expression were quantified by tissue zymography and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and compared between different segments of the aorta in young and old animals, and before and after Ang II infusion. Results: Old animal survival to 28 days was significantly lower than that of young Ang-II-infused Apoe-/- mice (P < 0.05). 64Cu-RYM2 PET/CT showed significantly higher aortic MMP activation before and 1 week after Ang-II infusion in old compared to young Apoe-/- mice. The 64Cu-RYM2 signal was significantly higher in animals that did not survive 28 days than those that did (P < 0.01). MMP activity significantly increased by 4 days after Ang-II infusion, when dissection was found in a subset of Apoe-/- mice; and was significantly higher in the dissected, compared to adjacent, apparently normal, segments of the aorta. MMP activity was also significantly higher in the ascending thoracic aorta of untreated young and old mice, as well as of Ang-II-treated Apoe-/- mice (which was associated with significantly higher Mmp2 gene expression), and of old wild-type mice. Conclusion: Aging is associated with increased MMP activity along the aorta and worse AA survival. MMP-targeted molecular imaging can inform the aneurysm survival prospects. Selective MMP inhibitors and tracers may help prevent and track aneurysm growth, dissection, and rupture.",

Using SPiDER SA-{beta}-gal labeled single-cell RNA-seq from regenerating mouse muscle, we found that curated gene sets show opposing enrichment patterns in experimentally defined senescent cells, suggesting apparent concordance in prior studies may reflect circular validation. Machine learning classifiers outperformed marker-centric approaches by capturing coordinated transcriptional features largely absent from differentially expressed genes. These features traced senescence progression, positioning senescent cells at late pseudotime with reduced transcriptional entropy. Ligand-receptor analysis identified IGF signaling as a directional axis of secondary senescence from senescent to non-senescent cells. When applied to bulk RNA-seq and an independent aging dataset, the classifier detected age-associated senescence patterns while the entropy-senescence relationship held across most cell types. These findings demonstrate that transcriptome-based classification provides a robust alternative to marker-centric readouts while enabling mechanistic hypothesis generation.",

    "summary": "Activation of the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway accounts for cellular immortalization in 75% of pediatric osteosarcoma. ALT does not rely on a single enzyme but instead, catalyzes telomere elongation via homologous recombination. There has been steady progress in defining the mechanisms that regulate the ALT pathway. However, the spectrum of genetic mutations that underlie activation of ALT remains unclear. Osteosarcomas, like many cancers, frequently harbor inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53. However, instead of single nucleotide variants that lead to expression of mutant TP53 protein, osteosarcoma tumors often acquire unique structural variations within the first intron of the TP53 gene leading to complete gene inactivation. TP53 is located on chromosome 17p13.1 in a head-to-head orientation and partially overlapping with the gene WRAP53 (WD repeat containing antisense to TP53). WRAP53, also known as TCAB1, is an RNA chaperone that is an essential component of the telomerase holoenzyme. TCAB1 functions to facilitate trafficking of the telomerase RNA (hTR) within the nucleus to ensure assembly and localization of the telomerase enzyme to telomere ends to promote telomere elongation. Loss of TCAB1 function abolishes telomerase activity, driving progressive telomere attrition. Here, using whole-genome sequencing of osteosarcoma samples we identified SVs within the TP53 gene that not only compromise TP53, but also inactivate TCAB1. These TCAB1 SVs were prevalent in approximately 40% of ALT positive osteosarcoma tumors suggesting that functional inactivation of the telomerase holoenzyme may be an early and previously unrecognized event contributing to the activation of the ALT pathway.",

    "summary": "Infection rates involving bacterial and viral pathogens have increased precipitously after the COVID-19 pandemic. While it has been speculated that higher infection rates resulted from increased hospitalizations throughout the pandemic or greater use of antibiotics, precisely why rates remain high today has remained unexplained. Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to occur post-COVID and may disrupt immune responses. Within T cells, SARS-CoV-2 infection is linked to low mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial apoptosis, and decreased mitochondrial respiration, which together impact cellular activation and function beyond the acute phase of illness. Here, we demonstrate that decreased mitochondrial function in antigen-specific T cells post-COVID may contribute to higher infection susceptibility by metabolically immobilizing T cell memory responses. Using donor-matched peripheral blood samples from 31 COVID-naive individuals who subsequently contracted COVID-19, we tracked how influenza A (IAV), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) T cell responses were impacted by COVID-19 infection. We found that gene expression linked to T cell activation decreased but mitochondrial redox pathways increased in CD4 memory T cells post-COVID. However, mitochondrial flux and reactive oxygen species production were limited in a plurality of post-COVID memory T cells after stimulation with IAV, SA, and VZV. Furthermore, we found a disordered relationship between memory T cell mobilization of glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation pathways post-COVID which resulted in diminished use of catabolic pathways including glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation in antigen-specific T cells. Modulation of mitochondrial function with metformin and ubiquinol partially rescued the post-COVID decline in T cell catabolism. Collectively, these findings indicate that COVID-19 infection may have lasting effects on inhibiting T cell memory responses to commonly encountered community-acquired pathogens which can be corrected with commonly available medications. This has significant implications for the clinical care of immunologically vulnerable populations in the post-pandemic era.",

Here, we explored this problem through the lens of DNA electronic properties, quantified by the vertical ionization potential (vIP) of nucleobase motifs, which reflects their susceptibility to oxidation. We analyzed genome-wide experimental data on oxidative DNA damage and found that the highest damage levels occur in regions with low vIP values, supporting a causal link between them. The analysis of cancer mutational signatures and their annotated aetiologies revealed strong anticorrelations between mutation frequency and vIP values, particularly in cancers driven by oxidative DNA damage, such as lung cancer. We further computed anticorrelations between vIP values and the frequencies of mutated motifs across coding and non-coding regions and across different mutation types, observing the strongest anticorrelations for silent mutations, consistent with their reduced selective pressure. Moreover, similar anticorrelations were observed for somatic mutations in cancer and normal tissues, as well as for germline mutations, suggesting that they arise from similar mutagenesis processes. This work clarifies how oxidative damage, DNA electronic properties and carcinogenesis are related and help identify genomic regions more prone to mutations.",

    "summary": "Age is an important risk factor for infections such as tuberculosis (TB). Telomerase is expressed in immune cells yet leukocyte telomere length declines during ageing suggesting an age-dependent loss of telomerase activity in the immune system. Leukocyte telomere length has been correlated with worse outcomes in TB patients, however the mechanisms linking telomere biology to TB susceptibility and response to therapy are unexplored. Here we use the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model to investigate the role of telomerase in TB resistance. We find depletion and inhibition of Tert, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, increases bacterial burden in zebrafish embryos. The Tert depletion infection susceptibility phenotype could not be rescued by p53 or STING depletion suggesting a non-canonical role for Tert in controlling mycobacterial infection. Consistent with a previously described role for Tert in developmental hematopoiesis, we find Tert is necessary for demand-driven emergency myelopoiesis to support containment of extended mycobacterial infection. Our findings establish a previously undescribed role for host telomerase in supporting infection demand-driven hematopoiesis to control infection.",

    "summary": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), has evolved strategies to evade innate immunity and establish persistent infection. However, the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis reprograms human macrophage metabolism remain incompletely defined. Tuberculous pleural effusion (TB-PE), a common extrapulmonary manifestation that frequently coexists with pulmonary TB, offers a unique, clinically relevant immunometabolic window into the TB microenvironment. Here, using patient-derived TB-PE samples, we demonstrate that this microenvironment induces a metabolic state in human macrophages that compromises their antimicrobial function. Lipidomic analysis identified an enrichment of the specialized pro-resolving mediator Resolvin D5 (RvD5), which signals through GPR32 to suppress macrophage microbicidal activity. The acellular fraction of TPE was sufficient to induce RvD5 secretion by monocytes, correlating with increased expression of RvD5 biosynthetic enzymes in pleural monocytes from TB patients. Mechanistically, RvD5-GPR32 signaling inhibited glycolysis without promoting oxidative phosphorylation, reducing HIF-1 activity and impairing intracellular M. tuberculosis control. HIF-1 stabilization restored antimicrobial function. These findings uncover the RvD5-GPR32-HIF-1 axis as a mechanism of metabolic immune suppression and a potential target for host-directed TB therapy.",

    "summary": "1The human Y chromosome enables detailed reconstruction of paternal lineages through hap-logroup classification. Existing tools for this purpose typically rely on outdated phylogenies, lack ancient DNA handling, or provide limited confidence metrics. Here I present yallHap, a Y-chromosome haplogroup classifier that integrates the YFull phylogenetic tree (185,780 SNPs) with probabilistic scoring, built-in ancient DNA damage filtering, and parallel processing for population-scale studies. Validation on 1,231 high-coverage gnomAD samples achieved 99.9% accuracy (95% CI: 99.5-100%) on GRCh38, and 1,233 samples from 1000 Genomes Phase 3 achieved 99.8% accuracy (95% CI: 99.3-100%). For ancient DNA with moderate variant density (4-10%), Bayesian ancient mode achieves +19.3 pp improvement over heuristic mode (+12 to +24 pp at 1% increments; see Supplementary Table S3), reaching 60-86% accuracy. On full AADR ancient DNA validation (7,333 samples spanning [~]45,000 years), this translates to 90.7% overall accu-racy (95% CI: 90.0-91.3%) versus 88.3% for heuristic transversions-only mode. At variant densi-ties [&ge;]10%, both modes reach 97-99% accuracy. yallHap supports multiple reference genomes (GRCh37, GRCh38, T2T-CHM13v2.0), provides detailed quality metrics including optional ISOGG nomenclature output, and offers multi-threaded batch processing for large-scale studies. The tool is designed for integration into modern bioinformatics pipelines, with example wrappers for nf-core/eager [16,17] and Snakemake [18] workflows. The software is open source, available at https://github.com/trianglegrrl/yallHap, and distributed via pip, Bioconda, and Docker.",

The choroid plexus (ChP) is a blood-brain interface that produces CSF and forms the blood-CSF barrier. However, how ChP pathology develops across the lifespan and contributes to AD has not been systematically characterized. Here, we report a multi-modal ChP atlas integrating single-nucleus transcriptomics from 49 individuals, AI-assisted quantitative histopathology across >500 postmortem samples age 16 to 105, spatial transcriptomics, and functional studies in 5xFAD mice. We identify fibrosis, calcification, and macrophage abnormalities as hallmarks of ChP aging, with AD pathology conferring additional effects, including expansion of a pro-inflammatory fibroblast-macrophage signaling niche. In 5xFAD mice, macrophage dysfunction is associated with impaired epithelial barrier maintenance and repair. Together, these data provide a foundational resource for understanding ChP dysfunction in aging and AD and propose the macrophage-fibroblast-epithelial barrier axis as a driver of ChP pathology.",

    "summary": "Cold exposure of mice is associated with adaptive molecular and organellar changes in brown adipose tissue (BAT) that promote thermogenesis to defend body temperature. We previously reported that the lipid droplet protein Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) robustly increases in BAT during acute exposure of mice to cold. We demonstrated that chronic induction of BAT PLIN5 within the physiological range in mice housed at room temperature mimics the effects of cold exposure in terms of increased thermogenic gene expression in BAT, increased BAT mitochondria cristae packing, and increased uncoupled mitochondrial respiration. Additionally, BAT PLIN5 overexpression led to healthy remodeling of inguinal white adipose tissue with improved systemic glucose tolerance and reduced diet-induced hepatic steatosis. Conversely, PLIN5 constitutive deletion in brown adipose tissue resulted in decreased BAT thermogenic gene expression and in BAT mitochondrial dysfunction but did not lead to cold intolerance or changes in glucose tolerance. We hypothesized that preserved cold tolerance despite chronic deficiency of PLIN5 in BAT was the result of compensatory white adipose tissue (WAT) beiging, as suggested by the observed increase in thermogenic gene expression in inguinal WAT (iWAT). To test this hypothesis, we developed a mouse model of doxycycline-inducible, acute deficiency of PLIN5 in BAT of adult mice (BiKOPLIN5 mice). After 7 days of doxycycline treatment and housing at 6 {degrees}C, PLIN5 was significantly reduced in the BAT of BiKOPLIN5 mice compared with littermate control mice but was unchanged in the iWAT of these experimental groups. Under these conditions, thermogenic gene expression was reduced significantly in the BAT of BiKOPLIN5 mice compared to Control mice, as were mitochondrial cristae density and uncoupled BAT mitochondrial respiration. These effects of acute PLIN5 deficiency in BAT were associated with cold intolerance, which was consistent with the observed failure in iWAT of thermogenic gene expression to increase beyond that of Controls. These findings clarify the essential role of BAT PLIN5 in the physiological adaptive responses of mice to cold ambient temperature.",

    "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy, in part due to its rapid progression and early metastasis. To uncover novel drivers of this aggressive behavior, we first analyzed Frizzled receptor expression in human PDAC datasets and identified Frizzled 6 (FZD6) as uniquely predictive of poor clinical outcomes among all ten Frizzled family members. High FZD6 expression correlated with significantly worse overall survival for PDAC patients of any age. Functional studies in human PDAC cell lines showed that FZD6 promotes mesenchymal phenotypes, including enhanced migration and growth in 3D culture, while FZD6 loss induces E-cadherin expression and impairs motility without affecting 2D proliferation. In vivo, conditional epithelial deletion of Fzd6 in KPC mice significantly extended survival, reduced tumor burden and metastasis, and remodeled the tumor microenvironment to suppress stromal activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of human and mouse PDAC tumors confirms that FZD6 is primarily found within the tumor cells and FZD6-activating, noncanonical Wnt ligands are found to be produced by the cancer-associated fibroblasts surrounding the tumors. Mechanistically, we found that FZD6 is a transcriptional target of specificity protein 1 (SP1), a factor upregulated in mutant p53 contexts and within basal-like PDAC subtypes. SP1 knockdown reduced FZD6 expression and signaling through the PCP pathway. Furthermore, reduced SP1 impaired cell motility. Together this implicates the SP1-Fzd6-Wnt/PCP axis as a key driver of epithelial plasticity and disease progression. These findings suggest that FZD6 is a central effector of mutant p53-driven EMT, and a promising therapeutic target in metastatic PDAC.",
