    "summary": "Cellular metabolism is globally regulated by various currency metabolites such as ATP, GTP, and NAD(P)H. These metabolites cycle between charged (high-energy) and uncharged (low-energy) states to mediate energy transfer. While distinct currency metabolites are associated with different metabolic functions, their charged and uncharged forms are generally interchangeable via biochemical reactions such as ${\\rm ATP{\\,+\\,}GDP{\\,\\rightleftharpoons\\,}ADP{\\,+\\,}GTP}$ and $\\rm NADP^+{\\,+\\,}NADH{\\,\\rightleftharpoons\\,}NADPH{\\,+\\,}NAD^+ $. Thus, their energetic states are generally coupled and influence each other, which would hinder the independent regulation of different currency metabolites. Despite the extensive knowledge of the molecular biology of individual currency metabolites, it remains poorly understood how the coordination of various coupled currency metabolites shapes metabolic regulation, efficiency, and ultimately the evolution of organisms. Here, we present a minimal theoretical model of metabolic currency coupling and reveal a fundamental tradeoff relationship between metabolic controllability and thermodynamic cost: increasing the capacity to independently regulate multiple currency metabolites generally requires comparable abundances of those metabolites, which in turn incurs a higher entropy production rate. The tradeoff suggests that in complex environments, organisms evolutionarily favor an equal abundance of currency metabolites to enhance metabolic controllability at the expense of a higher thermodynamic cost; conversely, in simple environments, organisms evolve to have imbalanced amounts of them to reduce heat dissipation. These considerations also offer a hypothesis regarding evolutionary trends in nucleotide-pool balance and genomic GC content.",

    "summary": "Here we identify the subunit e of FF-ATP synthase (ATP5I) as a target of metformin, a first-in-class antidiabetic biguanide. ATP5I maintains the stability of FF-ATP synthase dimers which is crucial for shaping cristae morphology. We demonstrate that ATP5I interacts with a biguanide analogue in vitro and disabling its expression by CRISPR-Cas9 in pancreatic cancer cells leads to the same phenotype as biguanide treated cells including mitochondrial morphology alterations, reduction of the NAD+/NADH ratio, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), rescue of respiration by uncouplers and a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Notably, metformin affects the oligomerization of the FF-ATP synthase leading to accumulation of vestigial assembly intermediates also observed upon ATP5I inactivation. Moreover, ATP5I knockout (KO) cells exhibit resistance to the antiproliferative effects of biguanides, but reintroduction of ATP5I rescues the metabolic and anti-proliferative effects of metformin and phenformin. Finally, a genome-wide CRISPR screening in NALM-6 lymphoma cells revealed that metformin-treated cells exhibit genetic interaction profiles similar to those observed with the FF-ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, but not with the complex I inhibitor rotenone. This provides unbiased support for the relevance of the newly proposed target.",

    "summary": "VDAC, the most abundant protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane, plays a central role in mitochondrial physiology. Its oligomerization has been considered to be involved in critical processes, such as mitochondrial DNA release and apoptosis; yet, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. VBIT-4, a small molecule widely regarded as a VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor, has seen extensive applications over the past five years without proper mechanistic characterization. Using high-speed atomic force microscopy, we directly visualized VDAC1 oligomerization in planar lipid membranes and examined the effects of VBIT-4. Unexpectedly, we discovered that VBIT-4 partitioned into lipid bilayers at micromolar concentrations and disrupted membrane structure irrespective of the presence of VDAC1. Complementary approaches (including single-channel electrophysiology, microscale thermophoresis, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics) corroborated VBIT-4 strong membrane partitioning and destabilizing activity, while showing no detectable effect on VDAC1 or its clustering. Consistent with this behavior, VBIT-4 induced VDAC1-independent cytotoxicity in HeLa cells at concentrations above 10 microM. Together, these findings demonstrate that VBIT-4 acts by perturbing lipid bilayers and promoting membrane defects rather than by inhibiting VDAC1 oligomerization. Thus, providing an alternative mechanism of action for interpreting studies using VBIT-4 underscores the need to consider its potent, nonspecific membrane activity in cells.",

Natural products like clove (Syzygium aromaticum) have shown promising anti-cancer activity, but their mechanism in OC is poorly understood. This study investigates the anti-tumour effects and underlying mechanisms of a clove aqueous extract (CAE) on a panel of patient-derived OC cells. We found that CAE significantly inhibited cellular proliferation and induced cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, CAE induced profound cellular stress, activating the transcription factor ATF-2. This was accompanied by a significantly increased lysosomal stress response, as evidenced by increased lysosomal mass/acidity, and a pathogenic hyperpolarisation of the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m). The bioenergetic crisis induced as a consequence resulted in a sharp reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Notably, the sensitivity to CAE-induced lysosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction varied across cell lines, revealing distinct phenotypic responses. Our results demonstrate that clove extract exerts its anti-tumour effects by orchestrating a multi-organellar stress response, positioning lysosomal disruption as a central event in its mechanism of action. This study provides a strong rationale for the further development of clove-based interventions for OC.",

    "summary": "Introduction Ambient air pollution, especially fine particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) has emerged as a critical environmental risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases, contributing to an estimated 7.9 million premature deaths annually. PM2.5 induces cellular toxicity and is hypothesized to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a pathological hallmark in cerebrovascular diseases such as ischemic stroke. Despite epidemiological evidence linking PM2.5 to increased stroke incidence, its underlying cellular mechanism driving this association is poorly understood. It remains unclear how environmentally relevant pollution concentrations affects brain endothelial function or influence stroke-related biomarkers such as the lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1). Method Primary adult male human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) were exposed to PM2.5 (5, 15, 75, or 300 g/m3) collected from an urban environment in southern Sweden, or control. Thereafter, exposed to normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (1% O2) and glucose deprivation, followed by reperfusion as a model for ischemic stroke. Cell viability, oxidative stress, inflammation, BBB integrity (claudin-5, ZO-1) and LOX-1 protein expression were assessed. Results PM2.5 exposure induced cellular dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation starting at 75 g/m3 PM2.5. Notably, decreased claudin-5 and ZO-1 protein levels and increased LOX-1 expression at concentrations as low as 15 g/m3 PM2.5, levels commonly encountered in urban environments globally. The cellular effects of PM2.5 closely resembled those induced by ischemic-like injury. Conclusion These findings demonstrate dose-dependent detrimental effects of PM2.5 on HBMEC. The results suggest that ambient urban PM2.5 may act as a predisposing factor for cerebrovascular disease onset, by causing endothelial and barrier dysregulation.",

    "summary": "Apple is one of the major cultivated fruit crops in temperate regions. To better support breeding programs and facilitate the development of improved cultivars, we generated a new haplotype-resolved version of the Golden Delicious genome, one of the major founders of many modern apple lineages. The assembly features the separation of the two haplotypes, with a total size of 647.3 Mb and 649.2 Mb, respectively. The phasing was accurately validated with 10,321 curated SNPs. Telomere-to-telomere continuity was verified by the analysis of telomeric sequence composition at the end of each chromosome. Gene prediction identified a total of 45,116 genes in haplotype 1 and 45,063 genes in haplotype 2. A pangenome analysis employing 6 haplotype resolved genomes identified both common and unique gene families. The availability of a phased genome enabled the assessment of genome-wide allelic specific expression. Our case study, focusing on Md-PG1 (a key regulator of fruit softening), revealed that the allelic form on haplotype 2 (GDH2-10g24673) was the dominant contributor to total gene expression. In addition, the phased genome also showed specific miRNA chromosomal distribution patterns, as well as a distinct methylation profile. Altogether, these genomic resources provide new insights into the allelic regulation of key agronomic traits and represent a valuable tool to accelerate apple breeding.",

Although prior studies in normal B cells and lymphoma models implicate p73 in B-cell lymphomagenesis, the functional role of individual p73 isoforms in DLBCL remains poorly defined. TP73, a TP53 family member located on chromosome 1p36, encodes both transcriptionally active (TAp73) and dominant-negative (deltaNp73) isoforms that differentially regulate apoptosis and proliferation. In this study, we characterized p73 locus alterations, isoform-specific expression patterns, and their biological relevance in DLBCL. Chromosomal analysis revealed disruption of the 1p36 locus, predominantly via heterozygous deletion, in 35% of patient samples, which significantly correlated with elevated deltaNp73 expression. Immunohistochemical profiling demonstrated a positive association between TAp73 and cleaved caspase-3, and between deltaNp73 and Ki-67. Conversely, TAp73 expression negatively correlated with the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-6. Functional studies in DLBCL cell lines further confirmed that TAp73 enhances sensitivity to serum deprivation and doxorubicin, whereas deltaNp73 overexpression promotes survival and chemoresistance. Together, these findings identify p73 isoform imbalance as a key contributor to DLBCL pathogenesis and therapeutic response, highlighting deltaNp73 as a potential biomarker of aggressive disease and treatment resistance, and TAp73 as a tumor-suppressive axis warranting further investigation.",

We tested the neuroprotective activity of MNP 021, a non electrophilic TRPA1 modulator, in neurons and glial cells in vitro. Methods: SHSY5Y neurons were pretreated with MNP 021 and challenged with MGO, then profiled by high-content imaging, RNAseq, Seahorse OCR/ECAR, glycolytic stress assays and AKT/ERK/CREB immunoblotting with or without insulin. In parallel, HMC3 glial cells were treated with MNP 021, exposed to LPS/TNF or A{beta} (25/35) and tested for viability and inflammatory markers by ELISA and qRT-PCR. Results: MGO increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm area ratio by 49% and dysregulated glucose handling, increasing 2NBDG uptake by {approx}25%, with GLUT1/GLUT4 membrane redistribution; MNP 021 normalized morphology, uptake, and transporter localization without cytotoxicity up to 10 {micro}M. RNAseq identified 754 MGO-deregulated genes, including ISR/metabolic nodes (GCK, SESN2, PHGDH/PSAT1, PCK2); MNP 021 buffered stress-induced transcription with limited baseline effects, remodeled mitochondrial redox readouts consistent with controlled ROS signaling, while improving mitochondrial content/architecture and blunting stress-evoked compensatory glycolysis. MNP 021 restored pro-survival signaling (pAKT/pERK and nuclear pCREB), including insulin responsiveness during MGO exposure. MNP 021 reduced IL-6/TNFalfa release while increasing IL10 and ARG1 ({approx}1.9-fold vs LPS/TNF) in HMC3 glial cells, shifting them toward a pro-resolving IL10/ARG1 program with reduced A{beta} (25/35) evoked cytokine release with GLP1 remaining very low ([&le;]10 pg/mL) and not significantly increased in this system. Conclusions: MNP 021 coordinates transcriptomic restraint, transporter-level glucose handling, mitochondrial resilience, and pro-survival/pro-resolving signaling across neuronmicroglia compartments, supporting TRPA1 tuned small molecule modulation as a candidate strategy against dicarbonyl linked neurometabolic stress.",

Despite significant research efforts, effective therapeutic interventions remain elusive due to limited understanding of the cellular effects of Syn aggregation and propagation. This study presents the development of a scalable cellular seeding assay for screening small molecules targeting cellular  Syn seeded aggregation. By leveraging a fluorescent reporter of Syn and phenotypic screening, the assay enables high-throughput evaluation of potential inhibitors in a cellular environment mimicking disease pathology. We evaluated three different Syn aggregation inhibitors tested in clinical trials for PD: Minzasolmin, Emrusolmin and EGCG and profiled gene expression using multiplexed single cell RNA sequencing in order to examine their distinct effects on cellular pathways associated with  Syn overexpression or seeded aggregation. Two cellular activities were prominently affected: lipid metabolism and rRNA processing. Notably, while EGCG effects were confined to cells with aggregated Syn, Minzasolmin and Emrusolmin also produced transcriptional changes in cells without aggregated  Syn. Each of the compounds tested induced a partial reversal of transcriptional effects resulting from Syn seeded aggregation. We identified 391 genes that were no longer significantly differentially expressed upon addition of compound, relative to cells with seeded aggregation. This platform bridges phenotypic screening and molecular pathway analysis, providing insights into druggable pathways for synucleinopathies. The molecular signatures identified here can assist in testing and benchmarking future drug discovery leads.",

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) biases T cell differentiation toward a cytotoxic fate at the expense of memory-precursor formation, making mTOR inhibition an attractive strategy to boost T cell memory during vaccination. Here, we used matched time-resolved mRNA sequencing and quantitative mass spectrometry to define how the human T cell proteome is remodeled during the first 24 hours of activation. We found that human T cells rapidly remodel their proteome in distinct, temporally ordered modules that drive translation and proliferation while promoting a cytotoxic T cell state. Notably, mTOR inhibition during the first 24 hours of T cell activation perturbed these protein modules. Strikingly, transient mTOR inhibition limited to the first 16 hours of T cell priming was sufficient to imprint a memory-like T cell state, while preserving the capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines and mediate target cell killing. Together, these findings indicate that mTOR activity dictates stable functional trajectories during early T cell activation, revealing a therapeutic window to refine vaccination responses.",

    "summary": "The insulin receptor (IR) is markedly overexpressed in both human and mouse prostate cancer, with a significant elevation in the IRA/IRB ratio across patient tissues, cell lines, and HiMyc mouse prostates. To elucidate the role of IRB in prostate tumorigenesis, we generated a prostate-specific IRB knockout (KO) mouse model using Pbsn Cre driven recombination. Prostate-restricted loss of IRB was confirmed at the transcript level and did not affect other tissues. Crossing these mice with HiMyc transgenics revealed that IRB deficiency promotes accelerated progression to invasive adenocarcinoma, characterized by enhanced cellular proliferation and atypical histopathology. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling of dorsolateral prostate lobes demonstrated activation of PI3K/AKT and mTOR signaling, along with upregulation of IRS1/2/4 and IGF2. Metabolite analyses indicated elevated fatty acid levels and enhanced lipolysis pathways, implicating metabolic reprogramming in tumor progression. Notably, glucose and lipid metabolism genes, including GLUT1, GLUT12, FASN, and GPR120, were upregulated, accompanied by an increased BCL2/BAX ratio, suggesting apoptosis inhibition. Functional studies further revealed opposing roles of dietary fatty acids: omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA, DHA) suppressed prostate cancer cell survival, proliferation, and PI3K/AKT signaling while promoting apoptosis, whereas omega6 fatty acid (arachidonic acid) exerted pro tumorigenic, antiapoptotic effects. Collectively, these findings identify IRB loss as a driver of metabolic and signaling reprogramming that accelerates prostate tumorigenesis, while highlighting omega3 fatty acids as potential modulators counteracting IRB deficient prostate cancer progression.",

    "summary": "Whilst the majority of individuals infected with M. tuberculosis control the infection and remain asymptomatic, only 5-10% progress to active tuberculosis (TB). Previous or current infection with M. tuberculosis is detected using antigen-specific interferon (IFN)-{gamma} release assays (IGRA), which cannot identify those who will remain healthy or progress to active TB. However, 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission-computed tomography (PET-CT) can detect increased immune cell metabolic activity in lung parenchyma and intrathoracic lymph nodes associated with infection. The local early immune factors dictating protection or disease progression have not been defined. To address this, we interrogated the airway immune response at single cell resolution in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) from extensively clinically characterised recent household contacts of TB patients, who either controlled the infection or progressed to TB disease. Using unbiased analysis of bulk and scRNA-seq of BAL samples, we define type I IFN-dependent and -independent neutrophil signatures in active TB patients and contacts that progressed to TB. We additionally report an inverse relationship between airway neutrophils and T cells, with T cells showing signatures of exhaustion, cytotoxicity and cell death in progressors and TB patients with a neutrophil dominated airway profile. Conversely, T cell signatures of protection in contacts who remained healthy were dominated by genes related to regulation, quiescence and a stem-like profile. We show that both the inflammatory neutrophil signature of TB progression and the stem-like T cell signature of non-progressors from human airways were recapitulated in scRNA-seq data from non-human primate (NHP) granulomas, associated with disease or immune protection, respectively. Our findings from early human airway responses in TB contacts reveal genes, pathways and cell states that may dictate infection outcome and inform strategies for host-directed therapy and vaccine studies.",

    "summary": "The immunization process unfolds through a precisely orchestrated sequence of innate and adaptive events across distinct anatomical sites. Although many mechanisms underlying vaccination are well described, most vaccines have been developed empirically, partly due to the lack of tools enabling rapid, organ-specific analysis of immune activation. To address this gap, we developed and validated a novel STAT6 reporter mouse enabling dynamic in vivo whole-body imaging and ex vivo analysis of STAT6-mediated anti-inflammatory signalling, and combined it with an established NF-kB reporter model to dissect immune activation induced by two LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccines encoding the same antigen but differing in RNA chemistry (unmodified versus methyl-pseudouridine (modified). This dual-reporter system enabled the creation of a spatiotemporal atlas of vaccine-induced signalling, revealing chemistry-dependent immune dynamics and identifying the liver as a predominant early hub for both NF-kB and STAT6 activity following systemic administration. Integration with antibody measurements demonstrated that early STAT6 activation followed by rapid signal resolution, rather than prolonged NF-kB mediated inflammation, correlated with robust humoral responses, suggesting that monitoring NF-kB and STAT6 dynamics could provide predictive insight into vaccine immunogenicity. Together, these findings establish NF-kB and STAT6 reporter mice as rapid in vivo screening tools for the early assessment of vaccine immunogenicity and performance. By enabling dynamic, organ-resolved immune profiling, this approach paves the way for more rational, mechanism-driven design of mRNA vaccines and underscores the importance of further investigating the effects of vaccines on the liver, both as a primary LNP target and as an immunologically tolerogenic organ.",

    "summary": "Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive corneal ectatic disorder marked by stromal thinning, enzymatic degradation, and oxidative stress. Conventional corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) therapy poses risks. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a catechin found in green tea, has been shown to cross-link collagen, inhibit proteases, and modulate inflammation, suggesting its potential as an alternative therapy for KC. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the protective effects of EGCG against collagenase-mediated stromal degradation in caprine and ovine corneas and (2) investigate the use of caprine and ovine cornea as viable ex vivo models for corneal ectasia research. Goat (n=4) and sheep (n=8) corneoscleral buttons were cultured in an air-liquid interface (ALI). Tissue viability was monitored by transparency grading and histology. The corneal ectasia environment was induced by collagenase type I digestion. An EGCG-rich extract was utilized for the treatments. Goat and sheep corneas remained intact for 7 days in MEM-based medium, though transparency decreased, with edema (whitening) by Day 7. Histology confirmed stromal loosening and reduced keratocyte cell density but preserved architecture sufficient for enzymatic digestion. EGCG pre-treatment and post-treatment exposure were associated with greater resistance to enzymatic digestion, with greater stromal preservation of quadrants in the EGCG pre-treated quadrant than in PBS pre-treated controls. This study provides proof of concept that EGCG extract confers protection against enzymatic degradation in goat and sheep corneas, highlighting its potential as a protective agent for corneal ectatic disorders like Keratoconus. Additionally, goat and sheep corneas can represent practical and ethical ex vivo models for short-term ocular research. Future work should focus on cytotoxicity, biomechanical validation, optimized culture conditions, and in vivo studies.",

Identifying proteins released in endothelial EVs in response to stimuli relevant to cardiovascular disease (CVD) may therefore reveal potential biomarkers that provide information about the vascular endothelium. This study aimed to identify differentially expressed proteins in EVs released from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in response to stimuli relevant to vascular endothelium activation. HUVEC were stimulated with TNF (10 ng/mL) or oxLDL (10 g/mL). Apoptosis was assessed using a flow cytometric DNA fragmentation protocol and caspase-3/7 activity assay. Size distributions of EVs were examined by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Isolated EVs were examined using tandem liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). While treatment of HUVECs with TNF or oxLDL resulted in non-significant elevations in levels of EVs, only TNF increased apoptosis. Mass spectrometry quantified 1355 proteins and revealed significant differences in the proteome of EVs from TNF-treated HUVEC compared to EVs from oxLDL-treated or untreated cells. Several candidate biomarkers were significantly and differentially expressed in response to TNF, including E-selectin and dual specificity phosphatase 7. This study further associated E-selectin on endothelial-derived EVs with endothelial apoptosis and may offer a biomarker of endothelial damage in patients with CVD.",

Progress has been limited by a lack of scalable technologies capable of jointly profiling these regulatory layers. Here, we present ME-seq, a highly scalable technologies capable of simultaneously profiling DNA methylation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility, while achieving a 100-fold reduction in cost. We generated over 400,000 single-nucleus trimodal profiles from the aging and AD mouse brain across ages, producing the first such atlas of neurodegeneration. We found AD progression triggers pronounced, disease-specific shifts in cellular composition, characterized by accelerated epigenetic aging and the expansion of disease-associated microglia (DAM). Integrative analyses, including aging clocks, revealed that DNA methylation acts as an early priming layer preceding transcriptional activation with IRF1 identified as a methylation-sensitive transcription factor serving as a gatekeeper for DAM activation. Our results establish ME-seq as a transformative tool for large-scale epigenomic dissection, revealing DNA methylation as a primary coordinator of cell-state transitions in the aging brain.",

    "summary": "Background Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HfpEF) is increasingly recognized as a multisystem disorder linked to the cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome. While the falling heart undergoes metabolic reprogramming, the interorgan crosstalk regulating myocardial substrate preference in HFpEF remains elusive. We aimed to clarify the role of systemic and local ketogenesis in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and HFpEF. Methods A mouse model of HFpEF was employed using a high-fat diet combined with NG-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (L-NAME). Cardiac hypertrophy and systemic metabolic profiling including ketogenesis were evaluated. To dissect the role of site-specific ketogenesis, we generated inducible cardiomyocyte-specific (Hmgcs2{Delta}iCM) and hepatocyte-specific (Hmgcs2{Delta}Hep) knockout mice of HMG-CoA synthase 2 (Hmgcs2), deficient in the rate-limiting enzyme for ketogenesis. Cardiomyocyte -specific nuclei were isolated for transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and in vitro assays in H9C2 cells were used to elucidate molecular mechanisms. Results The HFpEF model successfully exhibited diastolic dysfunction, impaired exercise capacity and cardiac hypertrophy with elevated circulating ketone body concentration. Myocardial metabolomics and snRNA-seq identified a profound metabolic shift characterized by the accumulation of long-chain fatty acids and Krebs cycle intermediates, coupled with the transcriptional downregulation of insulin signaling and fatty acid degradation pathways. Although circulating ketone body level was upregulated, Hmgcs2{Delta}iCM mice showed no exacerbation of the HFpEF phenotype. In contrast, Hmgcs2{Delta}Hep mice exhibited significantly aggravated cardiac hypertrophy (HW/TL; Hmgcs2flox: 7.41 {+/-} 0.87: Hmgcs2{Delta}Hep: 8.29 {+/-} 0.73; p = 0.0154). Mechanistically, hepatic ketogenesis was required to maintain circulating beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, which directly modulated cardiomyocyte metabolism. BHB acted as a metabolic signal to dampen fatty acid overload and facilitate glucose utilization. Conclusions Our study identifies a critical \"liver-heart axis\" where hepatic ketogenesis serves as an essential regulator of myocardial metabolic resilience. Impaired hepatic ketogenesis creates a metabolic mismatch that drives pathological cardiac remodeling. These findings highlight the liver as a therapeutic target within the CKM syndrome framework, suggesting that restoring the hepato-cardiac metabolic bridge may ameliorate HFpEF progression.",

TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) has emerged as an attractive target to enhance anti-tumour immunity, acting as a serine/threonine kinase that restrains immunogenic cell death and downstream immune activation. Here we report the discovery of a first-in-class TBK1 molecular glue degrader (MGD), CCT412020, identified through high-throughput proteomics screening of a next-generation molecular glue library. CCT412020 induces rapid, potent and selective TBK1 degradation across a panel of breast cancer cell lines. A cryo-EM structure of CCT412020 in complex with CRBN/{triangleup}BPB-DDB1 and TBK1-homodimer reveals an unexpected binding mode that bypasses the canonical G-loop and instead engages an unconventional site at the TBK1 homodimer interface, providing a structural basis for selective degradation. Functionally, TBK1 loss via CCT412020 sensitises tumour cells to TNF- and interferon-driven responses and reduced viability across a broad range of cancer cell lines. Together, these findings establish CCT412020 as a mechanistically distinct TBK1 degrader and provide a framework for developing TBK1-targeted degraders as immunomodulatory anti-cancer agents to overcome ICB resistance.",

    "summary": "The non-canonical translation of specific mRNAs has been implicated in oncogenesis and cancer progression. We previously identified eukaryotic Initiation Factor 5B (eIF5B) as a key factor in Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) mediated translation of a subset of mRNAs encoding anti-apoptotic proteins. Here, we demonstrate that EIF5B is predominantly expressed in cancer cells compared to other cell types in the Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) microenvironment. Higher EIF5B mRNA and protein expression are associated with poor patient outcomes. We show that eIF5B depletion in OSCC cells blunted pro-growth, pro-inflammatory, and pro-angiogenic signaling pathways and significantly increased TNF related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induced cell death. This is achieved through decreased translation of mRNAs encoding critical factors associated with OSCC pathophysiology. Importantly, the level of interaction of eIF5B with tRNAiMet was significantly higher in OSCC cells compared to noncancerous fibroblasts. This suggests that OSCC cells (but not noncancerous fibroblasts) rely heavily on eIF5B for translation initiation. In an in vivo flank xenograft model using nude mice, eIF5B knockdown in UMSCC29 cells led to a significant reduction in tumor volume compared to control tumors. Also, the immunohistochemical analysis of the xenografted tumor sections demonstrated decreased staining intensity of critical factors associated with OSCC pathophysiology in eIF5B depleted tumors relative to controls. Collectively, our data demonstrate that OSCC cells are uniquely dependent on eIF5B tRNAiMet interactions to sustain translation of pro-survival mRNAs. Targeting eIF5B disrupts these oncogenic programs, sensitizing OSCC cells to apoptosis and suppressing pro-angiogenic and pro-growth signaling.",

This requires regulation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) proliferation and enterocyte (EC) size. How the absorptive area of the intestine matches physiological nutrient conditions remains unclear.

NF-Y loss-of-function (LOF) in ISCs led to high proliferation and cell growth, a phenotype influenced by dietary nutrients. NF-Y LOF also increased nutrient metabolism, shown by more mitochondria and larger lipid droplets in progenitors. Mechanistically, NF-Y restrains mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in ISC by controlling transcription of mTORC1 signaling components such as Iml1 and Sestrin. Overall, our results demonstrate that NF-Y limits excessive intestinal epithelial growth under nutrient-rich conditions.",

    "summary": "Although ageing can be understood in terms of associated hallmarks and biomarkers, the processes which connect and cause these phenotypes are ill-defined. Here we suggest a unifying model of ageing as four distinct processes which connect the major observations and evidence into a single framework. It explains, from a single initial cause to the ultimate outcomes and diseases, why we age and die. We suggest that although DNA damage is crucial to shift homeostasis, ageing itself is not caused by simple DNA damage accumulation. Instead, only specific sites of damage are relevant when they affect selection and the resulting ageing processes. For clarity, each process is given a name. The first process, celerisis, results from the natural course of tissue-level selection for cells with elevated metabolic and proliferative rate. If the damaged DNA site gives the cell a selective advantage, it can spread within the tissue causing hyperfunctional diseases including cancer and fibrosis. However, many ageing phenotypes are more associated with hypofunction. Therefore, we suggest that our tissues have a mechanism to prevent the spread of hyperfunctional cells. In proliferative tissues, a second process, intrinsic ageing, is the result of this defence mechanism induced through cell communication via Notch. Slower metabolising mutants induce epigenetic changes in faster cells, and then epigenetically slowed cells slow other cells, causing gradual metabolic slowdown across tissues. The third process, extrinsic ageing, could then result directly from metabolic slowdown as body cells use less ATP. Mitochondria reduce catabolism, restoring ATP levels by burning less glucose and lipid. Build-up of these fuels in the cytoplasm reduces import, restoring equilibrium but inducing insulin resistance (IR), while the excess fuel is diverted to the adipose, causing weight gain, chronic inflammation, and metabolic syndrome. These outcomes could then combine with intrinsic ageing to induce age-related disease. The final process of mitochondrial selection induces intrinsic ageing of single celled life as well as post-mitotic tissues and organisms. Together, the four processes produce a detailed mechanistic map that explains the evolutionary significance of ageing, removing old paradoxes, and connecting the hallmarks into a causal framework that furthers our understanding.",

    "summary": "Aging leads to cognitive decline due to reduced neuronal plasticity and increased brain inflammation. Disruption of perineuronal nets (PNNs) is a recognized strategy to enhance neuroplasticity. Hyaluronan forms the backbone of PNNs, and 4 methylumbelliferone (4MU), an inhibitor of hyaluronan synthesis, has been proposed to disrupt PNNs and enhance neuroplasticity in young rodents. In addition, 4MU is also known as an immune response regulator, although its effects within the central nervous system (CNS) have been less characterized. In this study, we investigated the impact of long-term oral 4MU administration in aged mice (20 to 22 months old), focusing on PNNs intensity, memory, and neuroinflammation. PNN intensity increased with age, and 4MU treatment reduced it in 22 month old mice to levels observed in 10 month old animals; in the novel object recognition test, treated 22 month old mice performed comparably to or better than 10-month-old controls. Moreover, markers of aging associated neuroinflammation including astrocytic and microglial activation as well as peripheral immune cell infiltration were normalized to 10 month old levels or further diminished following 4MU treatment. Importantly, chronic 4MU administration was well tolerated in aged mice, with no serious adverse effects observed. Together, these results suggest that 4MU mitigates PNNs accumulation and neuroinflammaging while enhancing recognition memory, supporting its potential as a safe therapeutic approach for age related cognitive decline.",

A key first step in mounting successful responses to vaccines is for antigens to access the draining lymph node from the site of injection. This study tested the hypothesis that particle drainage to the lymph node is impaired in older mice after intramuscular injection. We observed fewer 20nm nanoparticles in the B cell follicle of the draining lymph node in aged mice after intramuscular injection. However, there was no significant difference in the abundance of larger 1000nm particles in the lymph nodes of aged mice, which are typically transported to the lymph node by antigen presenting cells. This data suggests that access of smaller antigens to the B cell follicle is impaired in ageing and may have implications for the initiation of T and B cell responses after vaccination.",

    "summary": "Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by scarring and remodeling of lung tissue, leading to progressive pulmonary dysfunction. Currently, very little is known about the steps involved in disease initiation and progression because models of IPF poorly replicate these processes. However, understanding the pathogenesis of IPF is essential to developing effective therapies. To address this, we developed a scaffold-based human co-culture alveolar organoid model that utilizes healthy and IPF human primary lung fibroblasts and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar type 2 (iAT2) cells carrying the surfactant protein C (SFTPC) 173T mutation of familial IPF, or their syngeneic corrected controls, to recapitulate epithelial-mesenchymal cellular communication during fibrosis initiation and progression. We found that the interaction between epithelial cells and fibroblasts plays a key role in inducing fibrotic responses in this model, with the secretion of chemokines, cytokines, TGFbeta and matrix metalloproteinases that mirror those observed in the serum of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the emergence of many cell subtypes observed in progressive lung fibrosis, along with key cellular interactions that correlated with the initial upregulation of fibrosis pathways, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, inflammation, and changes in lipid metabolism. The anti-fibrotic compounds, Nintedanib and the TGFbeta; inhibitor, SB431542, demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in the model, with IC50 values comparable to those observed in the clinic, and significantly reduced secretion of fibrosis-related factors. Overall, this study shows that the three-dimensional cell co-culture organoid effectively models progressive lung fibrosis, facilitating the investigation of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and serving as a patient-relevant model to better predict the efficacy of therapeutics in the clinic.",

Similarly, doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity affects up to [~]48% of cancer patients, limiting therapeutic options. Here, we demonstrate that vascular stiffness mechanically amplifies endothelial senescence phenotypes, identifying the extracellular matrix as a potential therapeutic target for both cardiovascular aging and chemotherapy-induced vascular dysfunction. Using polyacrylamide (PAAm) hydrogels to mimick soft (3.3 kPa) and physiological (30 kPa) arterial stiffness, and glass to reproduce pathological stiffening, we show that substrate rigidity enhances senescence markers including {beta}-galactosidase activity, DNA damage, and inflammatory cytokine secretion in both therapy-induced and replicative senescence models. Critically, we identify a protective effect at physiological stiffness, where IL-6 and IL-8 secretion is minimized compared to both softer and stiffer conditions, suggesting an optimal mechanical therapeutic window. RNA sequencing reveals stiffness-dependent activation inflammatory pathways including chemotaxis and leukocyte migration. Our findings position vascular stiffening not just as a consequence but as driver of endothelial dysfunction, creating a positive feedback loop amenable to therapeutic intervention. These mechanobiological insights provide rationale for developing mechanical-based therapies in cardiovascular medicine and cardio-oncology, where targeting tissue mechanics alongside conventional approaches could improve clinical outcomes.",

Here, using a new mouse model of IDH1-mutant glioma that recapitulates the characteristics of human IDH1-mutant low-grade gliomas, we demonstrate that IDH1-mutant glioma cells are significantly more vulnerable to cysteine deprivation alone or in combination with the ferroptosis inducer RSL3, compared to IDH1-wildtype glioma cells. In addition, treatments with the IDH-mutant inhibitors vorasidenib and ivosidenib further sensitize the cells to ferroptosis. Metabolomics analysis reveals that IDH1-mutant cells have altered cysteine and methionine metabolism with deficiency in transsulfuration, which is further exacerbated by cysteine-methionine deprivation and IDH-mutant inhibitors. Furthermore, dietary cysteine-methionine deprivation alone or in combination with convection-enhanced delivery of RSL3 or ivosidenib in vivo significantly prolongs survival of IDH1-mutant tumor-bearing mice. Our findings suggest that targeting cysteine and methionine metabolism in combination with IDH-mutant inhibition provides promising therapeutic strategies for IDH1-mutant gliomas.",

    "summary": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) frequently exhibits resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, highlighting the need for strategies that enhance tumor-specific T cell priming and improve immune access to the tumor microenvironment. Here we show that vaccination targeting tumor-associated mitochondrial antigens (TAMAs), derived from tumor-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) missense mutations, synergizes with PD 1/PD L1 blockade to overcome checkpoint refractoriness in the RENCA RCC model. TAMAs vaccination elicits antigen-specific T cell responses, increases intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration, and reduces immunosuppressive myeloid populations, resulting in delayed tumor progression and improved survival when combined with checkpoint inhibition. In parallel, TAMAs + checkpoint blockade induces vascular remodeling characterized by increased pericyte coverage, reduced vascular leakage, improved perfusion and reduced hypoxia. Mechanistically, vascular remodeling is driven by CD8+ T cell dependent, IFN{gamma} associated immune activity and is associated with endothelial apoptosis and diminished intratumoral CD31 signal. We further identify tumor-to-endothelium mitochondrial transfer as a mechanism linking mitochondrial neoantigens to the tumor vascular compartment: tumor-derived mitochondria enter human and mouse endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo, and tumor-associated mtDNA mutations are detectable in endothelial fractions from murine tumors and human RCC specimens. Human endothelial cells can present mitochondrial neoantigens via MHC class I and become targets of TAMAs-specific CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, including following mitochondrial acquisition from tumor cells. Together, these findings establish mitochondrial neoantigen immunity as a tractable approach to enhance checkpoint responses and reveal mitochondrial transfer as an antigenic bridge that expands immune targeting to the tumor vasculature.",

    "summary": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) primarily infects human lung macrophages, which serve as its major replication niche. Mtb can manipulate host macrophage cell death pathways to its advantage by inhibiting apoptosis and inducing necrotic cell death. However, the specific necrotic cell death pathway activated in human macrophages after Mtb infection remains unclear. Here, we used the THP-1 cell line and primary human monocyte-derived macrophage (hMDM) to analyze multiple programmed cell death pathways during days 1-3 after Mtb infection. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrates that Mtb-infected THP-1 cells or hMDMs rarely exhibited apoptosis. Immunoblotting shows that Mtb induces significant CASP3 and GSDME activation in THP-1 cells, but not in hMDMs. We show that Mtb, in THP-1 cells but not hMDM, induces a significant increase in GSDMD cleavage, a hallmark of pyroptosis. MLKL phosphorylation was not observed in THP-1 cells or hMDMs during Mtb infections, indicating an absence of necroptosis. No changes in ferroptosis markers such as GPX4 expression or lipid peroxidation levels were detected. Time-lapse live-cell imaging revealed no lysosomal membrane permeabilization prior to plasma membrane rupture (PMR). However, we observed DNA release from Mtb-infected THP-1 cells and hMDMs after PMR. The DNA released from THP-1 cells exhibits low levels of myeloperoxidase and histone H3 citrullination. High-resolution confocal imaging shows that Mtb is associated with the released DNA. We demonstrate that pyroptosis induction in THP-1 cells is dispensable for the DNA release and cell death induction. In conclusion, our results reveal that Mtb-triggered cell death in hMDMs bypasses canonical cell death pathways like apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis. Instead, cell death in both THP-1 cells and hMDMs correlates with DNA release, potentially through a pathway similar to NETosis in neutrophils.",

ZCWPW1 is a histone reader that recognizes PRDM9-deposited chromatin marks. We identify an unexpected role for ZCWPW1 as a regulator of rapid prophase movements (RPMs). Using super-resolution imaging, we show that ZCWPW1 is strongly enriched at subtelomeric regions of mouse spermatocytes, where it stabilizes TRF1, LINC complex components, dynein, and meiosis-specific cohesin (STAG3). Loss of ZCWPW1 disrupts telomere architecture, weakens telomere-LINC-motor coupling, and abolishes chromosome movement, leading to defective synapsis and pairing, and persistence of DSBs. These defects are more severe than, and mechanistically independent of, those observed in Prdm9-/- spermatocytes. Together, our findings reveal that ZCWPW1 acts independently of PRDM9 as a chromatin-based intranuclear regulator of telomere architecture and telomere-led chromosome movements, thereby linking telomeric chromatin state to nuclear force transmission required for faithful meiotic progression.",

    "summary": "DNA methylation is a central epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression, maintains genomic stability, and guides cellular differentiation. However, direct measurements of DNA methylation, such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing or DNA methylation arrays, are costly and require substantial DNA input, limiting their scalability for large cohorts and their applicability to emerging modalities such as single cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics. In this study, motivated by the fact that DNA methylation is fundamentally a metabolic process, we investigate whether sample-wise DNA methylation activity can be inferred directly from transcriptomic profiles of genes involved in methionine and one-carbon metabolism. We show that a compact metabolic model comprising seven core reaction steps and 98 genes accurately predicts total DNA methylation activity across matched transcriptomic and methylation datasets from CCLE, TCGA, GTEx, and an independent single-cell multi-omics data set. Building on this framework, we develop Total DNA Methylation Activity (TDMA), a physics-informed neural network based score that enables robust estimation of DNA methylation activity from bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics data. We demonstrate that TDMA captures methylation-dependent transcriptional regulation and identifies genes and pathways under epigenetic control. Applying TDMA to GTEx, we further reveal strong associations between the predicted total methylation activity, chronological aging, and established epigenetic clocks. We also demonstrated that TDMA can serve as a transcriptomics-derived epigenetic clock and highlights age-dependent roles of folate and glutathione metabolism in epigenetic aging. Applying TDMA to single cell and spatial transcriptomics data collected from pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we identified that methionine metabolism and DNA methylation regulates T cell cytotoxicity in the tumor microenvironment of PDAC. Together, this work establishes a scalable, modality-agnostic framework for estimating DNA methylation activity from transcriptomics and provides new insights into the metabolic regulation of epigenetic aging.",

    "summary": "The functional network architecture of the aging brain undergoes significant systematic and idiosyncratic changes. Emergent individualized network mapping approaches may yield better or more sensitive explanatory insight about age-related neural and behavioral variability, although most applications have focused on young adults. In the current study, we tested the validity and impact of mapping individual-specific topography in two fMRI datasets comprising 112 young (18-35 years) and 176 older adults (60-92 years). Older adults had more idiosyncratic network topography than young adults. Individualized maps from resting-state fMRI improved network homogeneity and fidelity to task fMRI activations, while also exhibiting intra-individual reliability and inter-individual discriminability over a 2-year interval. Last, traditional group-averaged (vs. individualized) network mapping had a moderate-to-large impact on individual-level estimates of network segregation, a widely-studied measure of functional brain aging. Therefore, individualized network mapping captures important heterogeneity in older adulthood and may yield more precise characterization of neurocognitive aging.",

    "summary": "Cellular stressors often cause widespread repression of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) activity, which is thought to facilitate a focused transcriptional output towards stress resolution. In many cases, however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that stress-induced downregulation of the general transcription factor TFIIB tempers expression of specific stimulus response genes. Following a variety of stressors, TFIIB is proteolytically cleaved between its cyclin folds at conserved aspartic acid residue D207 by caspases- 3 and 7. Cleavage in this portion of the protein significantly reduces the ability of TFIIB to form a TBP-TFIIB-DNA promoter complex in vitro. Using both overexpression and endogenous base-editing, we find that B and T cells that are unable to cleave TFIIB upregulate expression of a select gene set during apoptosis. These TFIIB-sensitive genes are primarily short, stimulus-responsive and proto-oncogenic loci, and cleavage of TFIIB temporally restricts their expression. Failure to cleave TFIIB during stress leads to aberrant lymphocyte proliferation during chemical perturbation. Hence, caspase targeting of TFIIB destabilizes transcription to tune gene expression, allowing for proper stress resolution.",

    "summary": "Long duration spaceflight is associated with neurological symptoms in astronauts, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using human brain organoids cultured aboard the International Space Station, we analyzed three independent spaceflights to demonstrate that exposure to the space environment triggers Space Induced Neural Senescence (SINS), characterized by chromatin remodeling, mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of viral-like transcriptional programs in the absence of infection. Multiomics analyses identified upregulation of endogenous LINE-1 (L1) retroelements, whose activity was markedly enhanced in organoids lacking MECP2, a known L1 repressor implicated in Rett syndrome. The resulting accumulation of cytoplasmic L1 DNA elicited an IL6 mediated inflammatory and neurotoxic response, which was reversed by reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTi) such as lamivudine or stavudine. Parallel preclinical experiments in Mecp2-deficient mice confirmed that RTi treatment restored neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis, function, cognition, and survival. These findings reveal that the space environment reactivates dormant genomic retroelements, providing an unexpected mechanistic insight into astronaut neurobiology and identifying a potential therapeutic strategy for both space-induced and terrestrial neurological conditions. Our pioneering study demonstrates the value of space-enabling research in accelerating drug discovery and the treatment of diseases on Earth.",

However, the property of melanocytes from hair follicle and epidermis, particularly, their molecular signatures remained largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the properties of epidermis and hair follicle melanocytes by biochemical and molecular biological assays. We found that epidermal melanocytes are differentiated and mature form of hair follicle melanocytes, and they are potentially related. Irradiation with NB-UVB did not induce cell death of hair follicle melanocytes as observed in epidermal melanocytes, but activate hair follicle melanocytes, promote proliferation and migration. In situ study suggested that after UVB irradiation, root sheath of hair follicles, particularly proximity of interfollicular epidermis and hair bulb become darker, suggesting migration and maturation of hair follicle melanocytes after UVB irradiation, rather than cell death. This observation provides hints and evidence to the relationship between hair follicle and epidermal melanocytes, helps to explain the contradiction of melanocytes cell death after UVB irradiation and the use of UVB in treatment of vitiligo lesion, as well as the perifollicular repigmentation phenomenon observed in vitiligo lesion after NB-UVB phototherapy.",

These include delirium, an acute neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating disturbances in attention, perception and cognition. Delirium is associated with disrupted brain energy metabolism but our understanding of this during acute systemic inflammation is limited. Here we hypothesized that LPS-induced systemic inflammation would disrupt brain energy metabolism in aged C57BL6J mice and that the consequent functional impairments would be mitigated by ketone body utilization. We investigated ketone body effects in sickness behaviour, inflammation, energy metabolism and cognitive function. Real-time changes in utilisation of energy sources were quantified by indirect calorimetry and administration of radioisotope-labelled glucose and betahydroxybutyrate. Mass-spectrometry metabolomics was used to index severity of behavioural distrurbances to changes in hippocampal energy metabolism. LPS precipitated hypoglycemia and induced a whole-body switch from carbohydrate to lipid utilisation. Despite this, hippocampal insulin resistance and preserved brain glucose was observed while alternative carbohydrates, mannose and fructose, became depleted. Ketone ester treatment reversed insulin resistance, mitigated sickness behaviour and prevented delirium-like cognitive dysfunction without altering pro-inflammatory responses. Our results show that promoting ketone body usage mitigates systemic inflammation-induced brain energy disruption and prevents delirium-like cognitive deficits in aged mice.",

    "summary": "Alzheimers disease (AD), though defined as a cognitive disorder, often presents neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, depression, agitation and sleep disruptions years before the onset of frank memory impairment. An early pathological feature is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated pretangle tau (pTau) in the locus coeruleus (LC), the brains primary source of norepinephrine (NE). While clinical studies link LC pTau burden to behavioral abnormalities, causal mechanisms remain unclear. We developed a translationally-relevant mouse model that recapitulates the LC-first phenomenon using cell type-specific viral expression of pathogenic P364S mutant human tau in LC neurons. Three months post-infusion, pTau accumulation induced anxiety- and compulsive-like behaviors and reduced sleep spindles without altering overall sleep architecture. Consistent with the behavioral phenotypes, electrophysiological recordings revealed significant increases in spontaneous and evoked firing of LC neurons, accompanied by robust astrocytic reactivity with no apparent cell death. Transcriptomic analysis identified upregulation of Hcn2 and downregulation of Clic6, suggesting changes in neuronal excitability. To further define molecular mechanisms, we developed a cell type-specific proteomics approach, which showed synaptic and metabolic alterations associated with LC-specific tau pathology. Early anxiety-like behaviors observed at 3 months diminished at later timepoints (6-9 months) and were replaced by anxiolytic characteristics. These findings demonstrate that pTau triggers phenotypes reflective of LC-NE hyperactivity in the early stages of AD pathogenesis, laying the foundation for the development of LC-based disease-modifying therapies to address neuropsychiatric manifestations.",

    "summary": "Hyperglycemia is a hallmark of type-2 diabetes and a key pathogenic driver of diabetic complications. Cullin RING E3 ligases (CRLs) are multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligases that mediate cellular protein turnover. The activity of CRLs requires cullin neddylation, a post-translational modification that can be pharmacologically targeted with therapeutic potentials. By using hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp analysis, we discover that pan neddylation inhibitor exerts both insulin sensitization effect in liver and muscle and insulinotropic effect in pancreatic beta cells. This dual action is mediated by Cullin 3 (Cul3), a member of the 7 canonical cullin family proteins. DI-1859, a selective Cul3 neddylation inhibitor, effectively protects against hyperglycemia in obese mice. DI-1859 enhances insulin signaling by preventing Cul3-mediated insulin receptor substrate degradation in liver and muscle cells. DI-1859 increases insulin secretion in a glucagon-like peptide-1-independent manner in mice and directly potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 832/13 beta cells and human islets. Mechanistic studies reveal that DI-1859 does not promote glycolytic flux or bioenergetics function but potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via mechanisms involving RhoA activation and cytoskeleton remodeling in beta cells. This study shows that a single agent targeting Cul3 neddylation simultaneously promotes insulin sensitization and insulin secretion to attenuate hyperglycemia in mice.",

    "summary": "The accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion mutants in post-mitotic cells is a hallmark of mammalian ageing and a key contributor to tissue decline in skeletal muscle and neurons. Although the occurrence of such deletions is well documented, the mechanisms by which they clonally expand to levels exceeding the threshold for respiratory chain dysfunction remain unresolved. A transcription-coupled replication model has recently been advanced, predicting that deletions affecting genes involved in a negative feedback mechanism gain a selective replication advantage. This model implies relatively short accumulation times for mutant takeover, a critical but experimentally inaccessible parameter since single-cell measurements are destructive. Here, we present a novel approach to infer such accumulation times from cross-sectional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data, exploiting the fact that mtDNA deletions are also reflected at the transcript level. To establish feasibility, we generated synthetic datasets using two stochastic models of the mitochondrial life cycle and used these as a gold standard. We then applied the Moran process, a classical stochastic model of birth-death dynamics, to calculate distributions of mutant accumulation times and to extract key parameters. The Moran model reproduced the distributions obtained from stochastic simulations with high fidelity, demonstrating robustness across different assumptions about mitochondrial regulation. By fitting the model to synthetic data, we successfully recovered the true values for key parameters like mutation probability, selection advantage, and the fraction of advantageous mutants. Our findings establish a methodological framework for estimating mtDNA mutant dynamics from single-cell transcriptomic data. This approach opens the way for application to large-scale datasets such as Tabula Muris Senis and Tabula Sapiens, offering new insights into the role of mtDNA deletions in ageing and age-related disease.",

    "summary": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion mutants accumulate clonally in post-mitotic cells during ageing and can reach high intracellular fractions that impair oxidative phosphorylation. Despite extensive experimental documentation, the mechanisms underlying this accumulation and the timescales over which deletion mutants expand within individual cells remain poorly constrained. In a companion study, we developed a stochastic modelling framework based on a Moran birth-death process and showed that key parameters of mtDNA dynamics, mutation probability, selection advantage, and the fraction of advantageous mutations, can be inferred from cross-sectional single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data. Here, we apply this framework to experimental scRNAseq data from the Tabula Muris Senis project, which provides a lifespan-resolved atlas of mouse tissues. We identify and quantify mtDNA deletions in limb muscle cells across multiple ages. Gene-resolved analyses reveal pronounced deletion hotspots associated with elevated heteroplasmy at ND5 and ND6, consistent with predictions that disruption of transcriptional feedback regulation confers a replication advantage. Conversely, deletions affecting ATP6 are associated with reduced heteroplasmy, suggesting an unexpected role of this gene in supporting mtDNA propagation. The distribution of unique deletion species per cell follows a Poisson distribution with a low mean, indicating limited intracellular mutant diversity, further constraining plausible accumulation mechanisms. Parameter fits yield selection advantage estimates that imply mean accumulation times of approximately 3.5 to 6.5 months from first occurrence to near-complete dominance. Our results support a model in which mtDNA deletion accumulation is driven by rare mutation events followed by rapid clonal expansion, and they demonstrate the potential of single-cell omics data to quantify fundamental parameters of mitochondrial ageing dynamics.",

While these factors are well characterized in yeast and mammals, their counterparts in plants remain poorly defined. Here, we used a proteomic approach in Arabidopsis thaliana to identify nuclear proteins that preferentially associate with telomeric DNA. We identified TRFL7, a previously uncharacterized member of the TRF-like (TRFL) protein family, as a prominent candidate. We show that TRFL7, together with its close homologues TRFL5 and TRFL11, associates with telomeric chromatin and forms distinct nuclear foci that preferentially localize near the nucleolus, resembling the nucleolus-associated telomere clustering characteristic of Arabidopsis. Genetic inactivation of TRFL7 in combination with either TRFL5 or TRFL11 results in telomere elongation, indicating a role for these proteins in telomere length homeostasis. Notably, TRFL7 contains an iDDR sequence motif that is also present in human TRF2, where it limits the activity of the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex. Together, our findings identify TRFL7 as a functional component of plant telomeric chromatin and suggest that it represents a plant orthologue of human TRF2.",

Using emerging deuterium-labeled probes, MATRIX-SRS visualizes subcellular TCA-associated carbon-deuterium bonds in live cancer cells and neurons. We then integrate density functional theory, reaction network mapping, and hyperspectral MATRIX-SRS to construct a robust in situ metabolic quantification pipeline. Integrating MATRIX-SRS with isotope-tracing mass spectrometry, we reveal a global attenuation of TCA activity during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, providing deep molecular insights. Applying this framework, we further quantify changes in deuterium-labeled biomass in absolute concentrations for the first time, under native and drug-treated conditions, establishing a generalizable foundation for live quantitative spatial metabolomics.",

    "summary": "Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) induces not only direct tumor cell death but also extensive remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment. Adaptive natural killer (aNK) cells, initially characterized in chronic viral infection, are increasingly recognized as functionally relevant immune populations in solid tumors, where they may contribute to antitumor immunity and immune memory. However, how aNK cells dynamically respond to chemoradiotherapy and the regulatory mechanisms underlying their activation in solid tumors remain poorly defined. To address this, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from cervical cancer patients collected before CRT, after the first CRT fraction, and after the second fraction. Single-cell profiling revealed a significant enrichment of aNK cells following CRT. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses demonstrated that CRT-associated aNK cells exhibit enhanced virus-defending programs with increased cytotoxicity. Among the differentially expressed genes, the transcription factor PRDM1 was consistently and robustly upregulated in aNK cells after both the first and second rounds of CRT. To investigate the functional role of PRDM1, we applied in silico perturbation analyses using scTenifoldKnk and CellOracle. Virtual knockout of PRDM1 resulted in a marked attenuation of effector programs and disruption of metabolic networks in aNK cells. Moreover, PRDM1 perturbation altered inferred cellular trajectories, reversing the progression toward the aNK cell state, suggesting a requirement for PRDM1 in maintaining aNK identity and functional maturation within the CRT-conditioned tumor microenvironment. Together, these findings identify PRDM1 as a key regulatory factor associated with the enrichment, functional activation, and trajectory stabilization of aNK cells following CRT in cervical cancer, providing insight into innate immune remodeling during CRT and highlighting PRDM1 as a potential target for enhancing radiotherapy-induced antitumor immunity.",

Lung transcriptomics reveal repression and rewiring of PI3K-Akt survival circuitry; in both models, phospho-Akt is reduced, FOXO1 is increased, and epithelial apoptosis is induced. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes does not impair lung mechanics, indicating that hyperglycemia or insulin deficiency alone is insufficient. HFD elevates circulating free fatty acids, and palmitate blunts IGF-1-dependent Akt activation in primary human bronchial epithelium. Palmitate also activates endothelium and suppresses junctional genes both directly and via epithelial conditioned media, consistent with epithelial-to-endothelial injury signaling; in vivo, HFD reduces CD34+ endothelial cells in susceptible lungs. In men with airflow obstruction, obesity and fatty liver are associated with lower FEV1. Together, these findings define pulmonary lipotoxicity as a lipid-driven epithelial-endothelial injury program that accelerates obstructive lung disease.",

    "summary": "The Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is a respiratory chain enzyme found in pathogenic bacteria, including Vibrio cholerae, and is essential for energy metabolism by generating a transmembrane Na+ gradient that drives ATP synthesis and flagellar motility. Because the molecular structure of Na+-NQR is unrelated to the corresponding mitochondrial H+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (respiratory complex I), it is a promising antibiotic target. Although it has been shown that Na+ pumping is mediated by an alternating-access conformational change in the NqrD/E subunits, coupled to redox switching of a cofactor, the thermodynamics and kinetics of the conformational transition, including the free-energy profile and the rate-limiting steps, remain unclear. Here, we construct redox-state-dependent Markov state models (MSMs) from extensive molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories in the oxidized and reduced states to quantify the conformational free-energy landscapes and primary transition pathway. To accelerate conformational sampling, MD simulations are initiated from diverse NqrD/E conformations generated by AlphaFold. Our analysis clarifies how the NqrD/E conformation is regulated by the redox state and by Na+ binding to achieve Na+ translocation. This study provides a quantitative framework for understanding ion-pumping mechanisms of redox-driven membrane proteins.",

Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model, we identified two distinct neuroendocrine signaling circuits through which motor neurons signal the gut in early life to shorten lifespan but in mid-late life to extend lifespan. Both circuits employ the same neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh), while recruiting two different gut ACh receptors ACR-6 and GAR-3 to regulate the transcription factor DAF-16 and HSF-1 in early and mid-late life, respectively. Strikingly, the gut expression of ACR-6 is restricted to early life, whereas that of GAR-3 is confined to mid-late life, providing a potential mechanism for the temporal control of the two circuits. These results identify a novel mechanism that empowers the nervous system to bidirectionally regulate longevity by differentially signaling the gut at different life stages.",

    "summary": "Oligodendroglial dysfunction is common in CNS diseases and injuries, but the molecular and functional responses of oligodendroglia to CNS pathologies remain poorly defined. Here, we report that oligodendrocytes (OLs) respond to demyelinating diseases by dysregulating serine protease inhibitor clade A member 3N (SERPINA3N). Homeostatic OLs transition to Serpina3n-expressing OLs (SerpinOLs) under other diseased conditions including stroke, endotoxicity, neurodegeneration, neurotrauma, and non-diseased healthy aging conditions. Mechanistically, general neuroinflammation or inflammatory mediators is insufficient for SerpinOL transition. Instead, oligodendrocyte damage/injury, even in the absence of neuroinflammation or glial activation, is sufficient for the transition. Phenotypically, SerpinOLs are characterized by molecular signatures of inflammatory and immune regulation and STAT3 signaling activation. Functionally, SerpinOLs exacerbate neuroinflammation and promote glial activation toward pro-inflammatory and neurodegenerative states. Together, our findings suggest SerpinOLs are a common population of injury-transduced OLs that amplify neuroinflammation and glial activation in the diseased and non-diseased CNS through SERPINA3N secretion. Our findings provide new insights into myelination-independent role of OLs in regulating CNS pathophysiology.",

    "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide, with a steadily increasing prevalence. Despite the advent of some plaque-degrading therapies, early intervention strategies are still suboptimal, largely due to an incomplete understanding of how early pathological events of amyloid-b (Ab) plaque deposition entail or accompany the neuroinflammatory processes that ensue. The APPNL-F mouse line is a second-generation endogenous-promoter knock-in AD model that represents a valuable tool to dissect disease mechanisms and evaluate therapeutic strategies. However, the early prodromal stage remains poorly characterized. Here we performed in-depth analyses in both homozygous (APPNL-F/NL-F) and heterozygous (APPNL-F/WT) mice at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Among a battery of behavioural tests, the first phenotype was observed at 9 months with defects in spatial memory. Using hypersensitive MSD-ELISA technology assays we quantified distinct Ab species and found that Ab42 oligomers, protofibrils, and fibrillar aggregates were detectable as early as 6 months of age in homozygous APPNL-F/NL-F mice. By 9 months, their Ab42 levels increased markedly and overt Ab plaques were detected, histologically associated with recruited glial cells. Targeted RT-qPCR analysis of neuroinflammation-related genes in the cortex also identified 9 months as a molecular tipping point in these 'middle aged' APPNL-F mice. To characterize the etiological signal transduction at the cellular level, we isolated microglia, the brain resident immune cells, whose contribution to AD pathogenesis is now well established. Sequencing around 5,000 individual cells from both 12-month-old APPNL F/NL F and APPWT/WT CD11b+ myeloid cells revealed that the buildup of amyloidosis was associated with an accelerated shift of microglia from a homeostatic toward a senescent-like state. Together, these findings highlight the 6-12 month period of the APPNL-F/NL-F model as a powerful system to study the interdependence between microglial senescence and amyloidosis in driving AD progression.",

    "summary": "Base excision repair (BER) is the primary pathway that removes oxidatively-induced DNA base damage from the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, with 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) initiating repair at the two most frequently-formed base lesions: 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoGua) and 2,6-diamino-4-oxo-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua). Humans expressing a catalytically-compromised variant of OGG1 (S326C) are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes, Alzheimers disease, and Parkinsons disease. To potentially enhance the overall catalytic efficiency of this variant, a prior medicinal chemistry screen discovered seven chemically distinct agonists of OGG1 that stimulated activity in vitro and attenuated a paraquat (PQ) challenge in cultured cells. Herein, we developed structure-activity relationships around one specific core structure, F01. Using fluorescence-based DNA cleavage assays, we assessed the abilities of these compounds to stimulate the overall rate of OGG1 catalysis. Multiple compounds were identified that increased OGG1 activity on DNAs containing a site-specific 8-oxoGua by 2-fold or greater, with 9 compounds showing EC50 concentrations lower than F01 and were specific for OGG1. Selected agonists were shown to enhance OGG1-catalyzed release of 8-oxoGua and FapyGua from {gamma}-irradiated high-molecular-weight DNA using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analyses. Since these assays did not reveal which step in the overall reaction was stimulated, we used a separation of function OGG1 mutant that possessed glycosylase, but not abasic-site (AP) lyase activity to demonstrate that the glycosylase step was not enhanced. In contrast, all agonists stimulated the AP lyase activity to levels equal to or greater than the magnitude of stimulation observed for overall chemistry, implicating agonist-mediated turnover as a potential contributor to the overall rate stimulation. The biological activities of selected agonists were evaluated in OGG1-deficient Kasumi-1 cells under conditions of paraquat (PQ)-induced oxidative stress, with several compounds mitigating PQ challenge.",

    "summary": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is a leading cause of acute liver failure worldwide. The RNA-binding protein Human antigen R (HuR) is a multifunctional post-transcriptional regulator that plays a pivotal role in cellular stress responses, including those triggered by APAP toxicity. This study investigated the mechanisms by which HuR protects against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in male mice. Hepatocyte-specific HuR-deficient (HuR Hep-/-) male mice on a C57BL/6N background and wild-type (WT) littermates were treated with 200 mg/kg APAP, and liver tissues were collected at 2, 6, and 24 hours post-treatment. APAP administration increased hepatic HuR mRNA expression and induced HuR cleavage and the formation of a higher-molecular weight HuR-immunoreactive band, with the latter two correlating with injury severity. Compared with WT controls, HuR Hep-/- mice exhibited markedly increased susceptibility to hepatotoxicity at both 2 and 6 hours. Metabolite profiling revealed altered APAP metabolism and reduced glutathione S-transferase (Gst) expression in HuR Hep-/- livers, consistent with impaired APAP detoxification and increased APAP-protein adduct formation. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy further identified early biochemical differences between WT and HuR Hep-/- livers as early as 2 hours after APAP exposure. Additionally, HuR deficiency resulted in pronounced mitochondrial structural abnormalities and dysfunction at 2 and 6 hours, accompanied by reduced expression of the mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins Drp1 and Mfn2, increased mitochondrial protein release, and enhanced hepatocyte death. Although pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were elevated in HuR Hep-/- mice relative to WT controls at 24 hours, hepatocyte proliferation was similarly blunted in both genotypes, consistent with severe liver injury and delayed recovery. Collectively, these findings identify hepatocyte HuR as a critical regulator of xenobiotic metabolism and mitochondrial integrity and establish its essential role in early protection against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity in male mice.",

    "summary": "Unlike mammals and birds, where new muscle fiber formation (hyperplasia) ceases around birth, large and fast-growing fish such as rainbow trout undergo a spectacular post-hatching surge of hyperplasia, followed by a considerably delayed hyperplasia decline. This study investigated the roles of the satellite cells (SCs) and their niche in this decline by determining the number and the myogenic capacity of the muscle progenitors as well as the functionality of their direct tissue environment. Histological analysis revealed a significant decrease in hyperplasia (fibers <25 micrometers) and SC numbers (Pax7+) between 10 g and 500 g trout. Transplantation experiments using muscle-derived cells (MDCs) from mlc2-GFP transgenic trout (10 g to 2 kg donors into 10 g to 2 kg recipients) demonstrated a marked decline in both intrinsic myogenic capacity and niche functionality as trout grow from 10 g to 500 g. Detailed analyses of GFP+ fibers produced after transplantation showed an enrichment of small-diameter GFP+ fibers in 10 g but not 100 g trout recipient muscles, showing a rapid impairment in niche ability to support hyperplasia. In addition, transplantation of MDCs from trout of different ages but the same weight, showed that increasing trout weight, but not aging, is associated with an impairment of the myogenic capacity of progenitors and their niche. Overall, these findings show that the muscle hyperplasia decline in trout is primarily driven by early impairment of the SC niche, followed by a reduction in their myogenic capacity and number, with weight gain playing a more critical role than aging.",

    "summary": "Glycolysis is a conserved metabolic pathway that produces ATP and biosynthetic precursors. Multiple allosteric regulators control glycolytic enzymes in vitro. For example, phosphofructokinase (PFK) is allosterically regulated by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26BP), ATP, ADP, AMP, citrate, acyl-CoA, and inorganic phosphate. It is not well understood which properties of homeostasis are enabled by each of these regulators, and whether they perform redundant or distinct functions. Using mathematical modeling and experiments with human cells lacking F26BP, we demonstrate that F26BP alters glycolytic rate independent of cellular ATP demand -- a unique function not shared by other regulators. We also identified several downstream glycolytic intermediates as novel regulators of F26BP levels. Our findings clarify the role of F26BP as a unique regulator that controls the glycolytic rate independently of the cellular energy state in response to hormone and biosynthetic precursor levels. The F26BP regulatory circuit enables respiratory fuel selection and biosynthesis from glycolytic intermediates",

Here, we show that high H2O2 imposes a translational constraint that prevents accumulation of TFs requiring de novo protein synthesis. Under low H2O2 conditions, TFs including p53, NRF2, and ATF4, accumulate and drive stress-responsive gene expression. In contrast, high H2O2 induces coordinated inhibition of translation initiation and elongation through activation of the integrated stress response (ISR), suppression of mTORC1 signaling, and activation of eEF2K, thereby blocking accumulation of these TFs. Inhibition of translation and repression of p53, NRF2, and ATF4 coincides with nuclear shuttling of pre-existing TFs, including FOXO1, NFAT1, and NF-{kappa}B. We propose that shuttling TFs provide a backup mechanism to respond to severe oxidative stress while translation is inhibited. Together, these findings identify translational control as a central switch governing transcription factor response to H2O2 stress.",

    "summary": "The glomerulus, a unique capillary network in the nephron, filters an entire blood volume approximately 300 times a day. Specialized epithelial cells known as podocytes form a critical component of the glomerular filtration barrier, and diseases linked to podocyte injury include minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and diabetic kidney disease. Because podocytes are terminally differentiated, their ability to respond to external stress is critical. The unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress pathway, is associated with glomerular injury, although the role of the UPR in glomerular injury is undefined. The UPR is initially protective, leading to upregulation of molecular chaperones, a class of proteins that promote protein folding and are required to survive oxidative and ischemic injury. An unresolved UPR, however, leads to apoptosis. We previously found that one molecular chaperone, GRP170, provides protection against acute kidney injury since GRP170 depletion led to UPR induction and widespread kidney injury. Here we generated a new podocyte specific GRP170 knock out mouse (GRP170Pd-/-). Surprisingly, GRP170Pd-/- mice were born healthy, and podocyte development appeared normal. Within a month, however, the knockout mice exhibited profound glomerular injury manifesting as proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and kidney injury. Concomitant with glomerular injury, we observed increased expression of the pro-apoptotic UPR target, CHOP, in podocytes. Together, our new model not only defines a protective role for GRP170 against glomerular injury but also provides a new model to test the therapeutic potential of small molecule UPR modulators to treat glomerular injury.",
