    "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by profound metabolic rewiring and a strongly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, both of which contribute to poor therapeutic responses. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) represents a potential strategy to overcome immune suppression by coupling tumor cell death to anti-tumor immune activation. Here, we investigated whether targeting amino acid metabolism in PDAC can induce ICD and promote tumor immunity. Through a focused metabolic screen in a panel of syngeneic mouse cancer cell lines, we identified cysteine restriction as a robust inducer of multiple damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in vitro, hallmark features of ICD. In addition to driving DAMPs, cystine-deprived tumor cells also promoted dendritic cell phagocytosis, maturation, and proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro. Because cysteine deprivation is a known trigger of ferroptosis, we further demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) similarly elicited ICD-associated features, which were reversible by the ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1. To define additional immune-modulatory signals associated with ferroptosis, we performed metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of cells undergoing, but not yet committed to, ferroptotic death. These analyses revealed selective release of immunosuppressive metabolites and oxidized phospholipids. Consistent with this, conditioned media from ferroptotic cells impaired CD8 T cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro. Thus, together our results indicated that the induction of ferroptotic immunogenic cell death led to the release of both pro- and anti-inflammatory signals. Subsequent analysis in vivo revealed that ferroptotic tumor cells predominantly contributed to a tumor-protective environment. In particular, tumors inoculated with ferroptotic cells were enriched with immunosuppressive myeloid cells and exhibited reduced populations of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Further investigation using immune compromised mice suggested that ferroptotic cells may suppress both adaptive and innate immune responses. Collectively, these results underscore the complex and highly context-dependent effects of ferroptosis on tumor immunity, highlighting the critical importance of in vivo models to determine true immunogenic potential within the tumor microenvironment.",

    "summary": "Flavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds that have been extensively explored as scaffolds for drug development due to their diverse biological activities. Brazilin, a homoisoflavonoid with reported antitumoral properties, does not fully meet pharmaceutical criteria, and chemical modification of natural compounds is often required to enhance bioactivity and efficacy. Here, we evaluated the pro-apoptotic activity of Brazilin and its semi-synthesized methoxylated (OMe)3 and acetylated (OAc)3 derivatives in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. We assessed cell viability, proliferation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial integrity, and analyzed apoptotic features using confocal microscopy, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. In addition, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize transcriptomic changes in MDA-MB-231 cells following treatment with unmodified Brazilin or its derivatives. Brazilin and Brazilin-(OAc)3 significantly reduced cell viability and proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas MCF7 cells exhibited increased viability and growth in response to Brazilin-(OMe)3. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment with Brazilin and Brazilin-(OAc)3 induced apoptosis-associated features, including chromatin condensation, {gamma}H2AX accumulation, and PARP cleavage. These effects were accompanied by a modest increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, no cytotoxic or apoptotic features were detected in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Brazilin treatment upregulated genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, including ATF3, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Brazilin and its acetylated derivative selectively induce mitochondrial stress and cell death in triple-negative breast cancer cells, potentially involving ER stress pathways.",

This study introduces Aeschynomene evenia as a novel model to investigate legume immunity and its interplay with Nod factor-independent symbiosis (NFIS). Inoculation of A. evenia accessions with A. euteiches strains revealed a range of quantitative resistance levels. Phenotypic and cytological analyses showed a compatible interaction, including root browning, intracellular colonisation, and oospore production; along with partial resistance traits such as phenolic accumulation at the endodermal barrier. Transcriptomic analyses at 1 and 3 dpi identified 3,403 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with upregulated genes associated with pathogen perception, immune signalling and specialised metabolite biosynthesis. Kinase-mediated signalling, ROS homeostasis, and WRKY transcription factors were among the most enriched functional categories. Comparative transcriptomics with Medicago truncatula confirmed conserved immune responses, while A. evenia displayed broader transcriptional repression. Integration with symbiotic transcriptomic data revealed overlapping gene signatures, including AeRLCK2 and AeCRK, previously found to be NFIS-specific, as putative dual-function kinases. Aerlck2 and Aecrk mutants exhibited enhanced resistance to A. euteiches, supporting their roles in immune regulation. This work positions A. evenia - A. euteiches as a valuable system to dissect legume quantitative resistance and its intersection with symbiosis.",

    "summary": "Macrophages internalize and kill bacteria and thus are crucial for clearing bacterial infections. Although macrophage killing of some intracellular bacteria requires inflammasomes, the specific mechanisms of inflammasome-dependent killing are incompletely understood. Here we show that, upon infection with an intracellular pathogen Shigella flexneri, human macrophages activate a robust NLRC4-caspase-1 inflammasome response that restricts intracellular bacterial replication independently of pyroptosis. Gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage is required for bactericidal activity, revealing a GSDMD-dependent mechanism of bacterial killing independent of host cell death. We find that GSDMD-mediated killing of S. flexneri does not require bacterial cardiolipin, identifying a cardiolipin-independent mode of bacterial targeting. Priming macrophages with interferon (IFN)-{gamma} enhances killing of intracellular S. flexneri by promoting involvement of caspase-4, which cooperates with caspase-1 to potentiate GSDMD function. These results identify a dual engagement of canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes that leads to macrophage killing S. flexneri while preserving host cell integrity. Furthermore, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized cardiolipin-independent mechanism of GSDMD-mediated bacterial killing with broad implications for immune cell control of cytosolic bacterial pathogens",

    "summary": "Zinc plays a crucial role in immune regulation, the oxidative stress response, and epithelial barrier integrity. Yet, zincs precise role in regulating metabolic and immunological functions in myeloid cells remains poorly understood. Here, we employ a systems biology approach using constraint-based modeling to elucidate the consequences of myeloid-specific loss of ZIP8 on macrophage metabolic function and antibacterial capabilities. We demonstrate that macrophage populations in the lung of ZIP8 knockout (Zip8KO) mice exhibit widespread metabolic disruption, spanning glycolysis, butanoate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Specifically, Zip8KO macrophages exhibit impaired nutrient uptake and dysregulated energy metabolism, which is exacerbated following Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Genome-scale metabolic modeling and flux analysis revealed a paradoxical pattern of metabolic suppression prior to infection, followed by overcompensation post-infection, potentially driving immune dysfunction. Consistent with these predictions Zip8KO bone marrow-derived macrophages displayed increased ATP demand and disrupted mitochondrial energetics, compromising their ability to control infection. Importantly, we identified succinate, and kynurenic acid as metabolites capable of restoring immune responses and validated their ability to enhance bacterial clearance in Zip8KO BMDMs. Together, these findings establish ZIP8 as a central regulator of immune-metabolic homeostasis and suggest potential therapeutic avenues to restore immune function in settings of zinc deficiency.",

    "summary": "Pre-clinical and clinical work on multiple tetracyclines revealed substantial neuroprotective and geroprotective effects that are unrelated to their antibiotic activity. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying the most widely used tetracyclines and their impurities or degradation products. We find that their neuroprotective and geroprotective effects can be separated from the inhibition of MMP9 or their antibiotic activity and instead result from an attenuation of translation. Surprisingly, tetracyclines differ in the mechanisms by which they attenuate translation to protect neurons and extend lifespan. The first class, best represented by doxycycline, targets the mitochondrial ribosome to activate the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which lowers cytosolic translation. In contrast, the second class, best represented by the atypical tetracyclines, 4-epiminocycline and 12-aminominocycline, bypasses the need for the ISR. Instead, these molecules directly target the cytosolic ribosome, reducing translation and protecting from ferroptotic cell death. Thus, the tetracyclines represent a tunable molecular scaffold that can be engineered to target either the mitochondrial or cytosolic ribosome, thereby eliciting different protective downstream mechanisms. Our results reveal a surprising mechanistic diversity underlying the tetracycline class and suggest a new avenue to develop therapeutics to safely target protein synthesis in humans, one of the most potent longevity mechanisms identified in small model organisms.",

    "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly lethal and characterized by profound metabolic rewiring, yet it remains unclear how fatty acid (FA) and glutamine (GLN) metabolism coordinate across glycolytic states and FA classes. In this study, RNA-seq and clinical data from a multi-institutional PDAC cohort (n = 172) were analyzed to quantify FA and GLN pathway activities using single-sample gene set variation analysis (ssGSEA), followed by stratification of tumors into low, medium, and high glycolysis tertiles. FA-GLN associations were evaluated at pathway, enzyme-class (medium, long, and very-long-chain FA; VLCFA [&ge;] C20), and family levels using correlation, Fisher-z meta-analysis, and bootstrap resampling. Family-level contrasts were used to compare FA-GLN coupling between glycolysis strata, and complementary metabolite-inference analyses were performed to define metabolite-based tumor phenotypes. Protein-level validation was conducted in an independent PDAC proteomic cohort. FA-GLN coordination was found to be strongly context-dependent: membrane-focused lipid families, glycerophospholipids (GPL) and sphingolipids (SP), showed the strongest GLN coupling in glycolysis-low tumors, whereas coupling shifted toward VLCFA enzyme classes in glycolysis-medium tumors and weakened in glycolysis-high tumors. Family-level contrasts confirmed significantly weaker GPL-GLN and SP-GLN associations in high versus low glycolysis. Metabolite-inference analyses identified three metabolic phenotypes that preserved this glycolysis-stratified FA-GLN hierarchy, and protein-level analysis in the CPTAC PDAC cohort partially recapitulated preferential SP-GLN coordination in less glycolytic tumors. Survival analyses suggested glycolysis-state- and chain length-specific trends in FA-linked pathways. Together, these findings delineate a glycolysis-stratified map of FA-GLN coordination in PDAC and nominate conditional metabolic vulnerabilities with potential therapeutic and dietary relevance.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/676164v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b17b8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b25687org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ec224org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1abf436_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Conceptual summary illustrating how coordinated fatty-acid and glutamine metabolism shifts across glycolysis-low, medium, and high PDAC tumors, highlighting FA family and chain length-specific metabolic dependencies.\n\nC_FIG",

Functionally, young SVZ-derived microglia exhibit reduced basal phagocytic activity compared with non-SVZ microglia in vitro, whereas aged SVZ microglia show increased phagocytosis. In vivo SVZ wholemounts reveal increased progenitor-derived material within lysosomal compartments of microglia with age, without an accompanying increase in SVZ apoptosis. Inhibiting complement C3 activation or reducing inflammation with minocycline treatment partially restores SVZ proliferation in aged mice, but does not reduce progenitor-derived material within lysosomal compartments of aged microglia. These data support a model in which microglial inflammatory signaling contributes to age-related suppression of SVZ proliferation, while microglial engagement with neural progenitors is sustained by additional mechanisms.",

TRIM28 binds ALKBH2 and promotes its K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas ALKBH2 enhances TRIM28 transcription and protein levels, forming a feedback loop. Notably, alkylation stress induces a biphasic response: acute MMS exposure enhances TRIM28-ALKBH2 association and accelerates ALKBH2 degradation, whereas prolonged exposure promotes TRIM28 degradation, leading to ALKBH2 stabilization and transcriptional upregulation. Clinically, ALKBH2 is frequently elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and is associated with worse survival, whereas TRIM28 exhibits prognostic value specifically in chemotherapy-treated patients. Functionally, MMS-cisplatin co-treatment increased DNA damage and reduced clonogenic survival by counteracting ALKBH2-dependent alkylation tolerance, linking the TRIM28-ALKBH2 loop to chemoresistance in NSCLC.",

Despite decades of physiological studies, the genetic tools to study hibernation have remained limited and the mechanisms that induce hibernation entry are still unknown. Focusing on the brain, we map state-dependent neuronal activity across the hibernation cycle in Syrian hamsters and identify the hypothalamic anterior preoptic area (aPOA) as a key regulator of hibernation entry. Single-nucleus RNA and chromatin profiling provided a map of neuronal populations present in the hamster POA and enabled the discovery and design of an enhancer AAV that selectively targets hibernation-associated aPOA subpopulations. Using this genetic approach, we show that Samd3-positive aPOA glutamatergic neurons are necessary for entry into hibernation and that their activation is sufficient to induce a prolonged hypothermic state with associated nesting behavior. Together, we identify the first neuronal population that controls entry into hibernation, opening new avenues for investigating and manipulating the metabolic and physiological mechanisms underlying this extreme state of ''suspended animation'' and its potential applications in aging and disease.",

    "summary": "Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), many people with HIV (PWH) exhibit persistent immune activation (IA) and suffer metabolic comorbidities. We investigated whether residual HIV production in lymphoid tissues drives IA. Among 20 ART-suppressed PWH, HIV RNA+ cells were detected in lymph nodes and correlated directly with markers of pyroptosis, assessed via cleaved gasdermin D positivity, but not with most plasma cytokines or IA markers. Notably, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), an enteroendocrine hormone with anti-inflammatory roles, was upregulated in the ileum of PWH and correlated directly with systemic cytokines but inversely with lymph node pyroptosis. These findings suggest that chronic occult inflammation in people with successfully suppressed HIV infection is mediated by persistent virus production in lymph nodes leading to pyroptosis, which may trigger compensatory anti-inflammatory enteroendocrine activation that may dampen pyroptosis. Targeting pyroptosis or enhancing GLP-1 signaling represent potential therapeutic strategies for modulating IA and managing metabolic comorbidities in PWH.",

    "summary": "Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a heterogeneous syndrome of hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to dysregulated pulmonary inflammation, is caused by diverse insults. Because of this heterogeneity, mechanisms and treatments are difficult to study. As a treatment, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has had mixed results. PUFAs and downstream oxylipins are important to pulmonary inflammation but are not well defined in ARDS. We hypothesized that differences in fatty acid metabolism, as measured by levels of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs and oxylipins, are associated with differences in ARDS outcomes, ARDS causes, and inflammation. To test this, PUFAs/oxylipins were measured by LC MS/MS in plasma samples from 90 patients with ARDS. Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8) were measured by ELISA. Multivariate linear regressions modeled the relationship between PUFAs/oxylipins, inflammation, and ARDS mortality, severity and cause. Multiple n-3 and n-6 PUFA derived oxylipins were decreased in severe ARDS. We did not detect differences in PUFAs/oxylipins by mortality. PUFAs/oxylipins varied by cause of ARDS, especially between patients with sepsis and those with trauma. Furthermore, specific oxylipins were associated with IL-6 and IL-8. Based on our identification of oxylipins that vary by disease severity and injury, these metabolites should be considered as potential biomarkers and mechanisms of lung repair biomarkers. Furthermore, differences in PUFAs did not directly correlate with changes in oxylipins, suggesting differences in lipid metabolism by etiology of injury. Further consideration of differences in lipid metabolism in ARDS could identify potential subgroups that could benefit from n-3 PUFA supplementation or other therapies.",

Using AlphaFold3, we modeled full-length 3D structures of the IAP antagonists Reaper, Hid, Grim, Sickle, and Jafrac2, as well as DIAP1 and dBruce, and their binary and higher-order complexes. We uncover a paradoxical role for the N-terminal methionine of Reaper in stabilizing Reaper/Hid complexes and inhibiting DIAP1 binding. Our models reveal that Reaper uniquely engages both BIR1 and BIR2 domains of DIAP1, guided by -helical residues in its backbone, while all other IAP antagonists preferentially target BIR2. Higher-order assemblies show how Reaper and Hid cooperatively engage DIAP1 and allosterically modulate its E3 ligase activity. We present the first full-length model of dBruce and its inhibitory interaction with Rpr. These findings provide a comprehensive structural framework for apoptosis regulation in Drosophila, and offer new insights into conserved mechanisms of caspase control and IAP antagonism across species.",

    "summary": "Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional regulators that orchestrate the canonical response to low-oxygen tension in animal cells. Vertebrates possess three HIF-a isoforms, which arose from two gene duplication events of the ancestral HIF-1a gene. Here, we examined whether the HIF gene family (HIF-1a, HIF-2a, HIF-3a, and HIF-1aN inhibitor) shows evidence of positive selection in hypoxia-tolerant reptiles (Testudines), compared evolutionary patterns within the family, and assessed the transcriptional response to hypoxia in primary cells derived from a hypoxia-tolerant (Caretta caretta) and a non-tolerant (Sceloporus occidentalis) reptile. We found that HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and HIF-1aN are highly conserved across reptiles, whereas HIF-3a is under positive selection in Testudines. We also identified multiple novel regulatory motifs unique to Testudines. Transcriptional signatures of hypoxia exposure indicated stark differences between lizards and turtles. Whereas lizard cells exhibited a canonical response to hypoxia, characterized by enriched cell-survival pathways, sea turtle cells exhibit a robust, distinctive transcriptional response involving enriched pathways related to protein synthesis, quality maintenance, and mitochondrial integrity. Surprisingly, cis-regulatory element analysis did not show HIFs as key regulators of the transcriptional response in either species. Instead, TFDP1 in lizard cells and E2F1 in sea turtle cells emerged as potential key regulators. TFDP1 regulates the cell cycle, specifically DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, while E2F regulates DNA-damage response, apoptosis, metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. These results suggest that the reptilian response to hypoxia is shaped by transcriptional plasticity, while highlighting key regulatory mechanisms driving hypoxic adaptation in sea turtle cells. However, positive selection of HIF-3a and novel HIF motifs suggest a combined, but yet to be uncovered, contribution of regulatory and coding sequence evolutionary mechanisms shaping hypoxia tolerance in Testudines.",

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified major constituents of EEP, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and sugars. Antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays. EEP exhibited significantly higher radical scavenging activity than WEP, with maximum DPPH inhibition of 87.46% at 5 mg/mL. CAPE effectively scavenged superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and protected plasmid DNA from oxidative damage. These results highlight CAPE as bioactive compound contributing to the antioxidant properties of Thai propolis.

    "summary": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age related joint disease-causing chronic pain. This study investigated how nociceptive and sympathetic nerve innervation in the mouse knee joint changes with age and OA progression, and how these changes relate to pain and disease severity. Methods: Thirty-eight mice were assigned to four groups: young male (My), aged male (Ma), young female (Fy), and aged female (Fa). Pain sensitivity was evaluated via Pressure Application Measurement (PAM), and joint damage was graded using OARSI scoring. CGRP and PIEZO2 expressions in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were also assessed. We employed iDISCO tissue clearing and 3D light sheet fluorescence microscopy to visualize total (PGP9.5), nociceptive (CGRP), and sympathetic (TH) nerve fibers in anterior regions of mouse knee joints. A MATLAB-based tool quantified nerve architecture. Results: The Ma group displayed the highest OA severity and markedly lower mechanical withdrawal thresholds compared with My, suggesting an age effect on pain-related behavior. This phenotype was accompanied by a higher total PGP9.5; nerve fiber density in the knee joint and increased CGRP nociceptive innervation. In contrast, female mice showed no age-dependent change in PAM withdrawal thresholds, consistent with preserved cartilage integrity and stable OARSI scores, and no detectable age-related differences in PGP9.5; or CGRP; innervation. The TH; sympathetic fiber distribution was comparable across sexes and ages. Consistent with joint-level findings, DRG analyses demonstrated increased CGRP and PIEZO2 expression in the Ma group, whereas females exhibited no significant change. Conclusion: Enhanced nociceptive but not sympathetic nerve remodeling in knee cavities is associated with increased OA severity and knee pain in the Ma group. These findings emphasize the role of peripheral sensory plasticity in OA pain and demonstrate the value of 3D imaging for visualizing neuroanatomical changes in joint disorders.",

However, interactions between neural and vascular cells are largely missing in most brain organoids, which are crucial models for studying neurodevelopment and disease. Here, we establish vascularized cortical assembloids (vCAs) by fusing mesoderm-derived vascular organoids (VOs) with cortical organoids (COs). vCAs self-assemble lumenized networks of endothelial cells, pericytes, and perivascular fibroblasts that acquire blood-brain barrier (BBB) specialization and arteriovenous specification in vitro. Single-cell RNA-sequencing and immunofluorescence imaging revealed that vascularization improves neuroepithelial architecture, reduces hypoxia and apoptosis, expands cortical progenitor pools, and enhances neuronal maturation and connectivity compared with COs. Moreover, atlas-level integration with human neurodevelopmental tissue and cross-protocol benchmarking demonstrate superior transcriptional concordance, especially for vascular cell and glial populations, relative to existing approaches. This scalable and reproducible platform improves fidelity and throughput for modeling human neurovascular co-development and enables systematic studies across brain regions and diseases using engineered or patient-derived iPSCs.",

    "summary": "The rapid and sustained proliferation of cancer cells necessitates increased protein production, which, along with their disrupted metabolism, elevates the likelihood of translation errors. Ribosome-associated quality control (RQC), a recently identified mechanism, mitigates ribosome collisions resulting from frequent translation stalls. However, the precise pathophysiological role of the RQC pathway in oncogenesis remains ambiguous. Our research centered on the pathogenic implications of mitochondrial stress-induced protein carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine tailing (msiCAT-tailing), a specific RQC response to translational arrest on the outer mitochondrial membrane, in glioblastoma (GBM). The presence of msiCAT-tailed mitochondrial proteins was observed commonly in glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). The exogenous introduction of the mitochondrial ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha (ATP5) protein, accompanied by artificial CAT-tail mimicking sequences, enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and inhibited the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). These alterations in mitochondrial characteristics provided resistance to staurosporine (STS)-induced apoptosis in GBM cells. Consequently, msiCAT-tailing can foster cell survival and migration, whereas blocking msiCAT-tailing via genetic or pharmacological intervention can impede GBM cell overgrowth.\n\nImpact StatementThe Carboxyl-Terminal Alanine-Threonine-tailed protein ATP5 helps glioblastoma mitochondria maintain a high membrane potential and keep the permeability transition pore closed, thereby promoting tumor growth and increasing resistance to apoptosis.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGlioblastoma (GBM) cells have a disturbed RQC pathway\nC_LIO_LImsiCAT-tailing on ATP5 in GBM cells increases mitochondrial membrane potential\nC_LIO_LIThis msiCAT-tailing prevents MPTP opening\nC_LIO_LIATP5 msiCAT-tailing also inhibits drug-induced apoptosis in GBM cells\nC_LIO_LIBlocking msiCAT-tailing impedes the overall growth of GBM cells\nC_LI",

However, even with the use of TIL therapy, cancer cells can survive for various reasons, such as poor lymphocyte infiltration into tumors, chronic activation of the T cell receptor and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment[3]. Cytokine-inducible SH2-containing (CISH) protein is a negative regulator of T cell activation, and in a recent clinical trial was knocked out in TILs to improve TIL therapy efficacy[4]. A mechanistic signaling pathway model was developed to theoretically evaluate the efficacy of CISH knockout (CISH KO) in T cell activation and examine potential alternative target genes that can theoretically be targeted using multiplex gene-editing or drugs to further improve T cell activation and function[5]. Based on the results, CISH knockout increases the transcription of activation biomarkers IL-2 and TNF-a, but also inhibitory biomarkers such as PD1 and FasL. Using global sensitivity analysis, we also found that GSK3B, which is responsible for the deactivation of NFAT, is also predicted to further increase T cell activation when knocked out. In addition, it was predicted that PDCD1, FAS and CTLA4 can be knocked out in combination with CISH to further enhance T cell activation and prevent exhaustion and apoptosis.",

Growth-induced pressure increases up to ten times compared to healthy tissue in tumors such as pancreatic cancer, and rises alongside the occurrence of genetic alterations during tumorigenesis. This study aims to understand the so far unknown relationship between genetic alterations and cancer cell behavior under compression. Results: Using isogenic cell lines with engineered p53 mutations, we showed that the p53 background influences cell response to compression. Tumor growth under compression increased in cells harboring a truncated-mutated p53 form. This blocked caspase 3 cleavage and promoted survival and growth through PI3K-AKT activation and dysregulation of c-FOS and FOSB transcription factors network. Mutated-truncated p53 cells displayed a unique behavior and heightened an activation state under compression. Conclusion: Mechanical compression and p53 mutations together drive tumor growth. p53 status could be a biomarker for predicting tumor adaptation to mechanical stress and efficiency of therapies targeting mechanosensitive pathways.",

How limitations in this process contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction under stress remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the mitochondrial insertase Oxa1L as a key buffering factor that modulates mitochondrial vulnerability under Parkinsonian stress conditions. Transcriptomic analyses and cellular stress models reveal pronounced disruption of oxidative phosphorylation pathways accompanied by reduced Oxa1L abundance. Functional gain- and loss-of-function analyses demonstrate that Oxa1L actively influences mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species levels, and ATP production during stress. Notably, Oxa1L selectively governs the abundance of mitochondrially encoded respiratory chain subunits, indicating that co-translational membrane insertion represents a rate-limiting step in mitochondrial protein biogenesis. Structural analyses position Oxa1L at the mitoribosomal exit site, providing a spatial framework for coupling translation to inner membrane insertion. Together, our findings uncover a critical layer of mitochondrial quality control at the level of co-translational insertion and establish Oxa1L as a determinant of mitochondrial resilience under stress.",

Despite pronounced clinical deterioration, including severe proteinuria, reduced organ weights, and marked neuroaxonal damage, this mouse did not show a globally exacerbated cytokine profile relative to other MRL/Lpr animals. In contrast, plasma neurofilament light chain levels were massively elevated, indicating substantial neuroaxonal injury. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed a profoundly altered biochemical signature, with coordinated disruptions in nitrogen handling, sulfur amino acid metabolism, and neurometabolic pathways, clearly separating this animal from both control and lupus-prone peers.\n\nThese findings illustrate that extreme disease severity can emerge independently of overt cytokine escalation and identify metabolic dysregulation as a major dimension of pathological divergence at advanced disease stages. Although descriptive and based on a single individual, this work highlights the value of extreme phenotypes for uncovering biological inflection points that remain concealed in averaged analyses and supports the integration of metabolic readouts alongside inflammatory markers in autoimmune disease research.",

While antiretroviral therapy (ART) is linked to chronic inflammation in people living with HIV, its direct effects on immune phenotype, function, and metabolism in HIV-negative individuals remain unclear.\n\nMethodsGay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) on daily TDF/FTC PrEP underwent immunophenotyping and single-cell metabolic profiling using SCENITH. Cytokine and chemokine responses were measured ex vivo and after lipopolysaccharide or Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulation. These were compared with a demographically similar PrEP-naive cohort, with five individuals followed 6-9 months after PrEP initiation.\n\nFindingsMonocytes from people taking PrEP (n=15; median 533 days) exhibited higher activation marker expression (HLA-DR, CD14) ex vivo and enhanced IL-1{beta} and TNF after bacterial challenge compared with PrEP-naive individuals (n=11). Longitudinal follow-up indicated that PrEP initiation increased monocyte activation markers (HLA-DR, CD14, CD40, TNFRI/II) and cytokine production (IL-1{beta}, TNF, GM-CSF, IFN-{gamma}, Granzyme B, MIP-1). Reduced glucose dependency was observed in monocytes, CD56dim NK cells and CD4+ T cells 6-9 months after PrEP initiation.\n\nInterpretationDaily TDF/FTC promotes monocyte activation, enhances pro-inflammatory responses, and reprogrammes immune cell metabolism, highlighting ARTs potential to modulate immune-mediated inflammatory pathways in HIV-negative individuals.\n\nFundingTrinity Translational Medicine Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, The Association of Physicians of Great Britain and Ireland, Health Research Board Ireland.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=85 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/698427v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139c54eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c890d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9bdb4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5a2dc1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSDespite effective viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy (ART), people living with HIV (PLWHIV) experience persistent immune activation and chronic inflammation that increase their risk of age-associated comorbidities. The extent to which ART itself contributes to this dysregulated immune state remains unclear, as HIV infection confounds most studies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) offers a unique opportunity to examine the direct immunological effects of ART in HIV-negative individuals. However, few studies have explored how PrEP influences immune cell activation, effector function, or cellular metabolism in the absence of viral infection.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study is the first to characterise how daily PrEP with TDF/FTC modulates innate immune activation and cellular metabolism independently of HIV infection. We show that PrEP enhances monocyte activation and effector cytokine production while reprogramming metabolic pathways to reduce glucose dependency in monocytes, NK cells, and CD4 T cells. These findings reveal previously unrecognised immunometabolic effects of ART in HIV-negative individuals, providing mechanistic insight into how ART exposure can shape immune homeostasis in the absence of infection.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceOur findings, together with existing data from PLWHIV, suggest that ART itself can remodel immune and metabolic pathways, potentially contributing to both beneficial and detrimental outcomes. ART-induced immunometabolic reprogramming may underlie persistent inflammation and the early onset of comorbidities observed in treated HIV infection, while also enhancing innate responsiveness to bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Understanding these mechanisms may inform future strategies to optimise ART regimens and mitigate inflammation-associated complications.",

    "summary": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and excessive oxidative stress within mitochondria are key pathological factors driving renal tubular injury in diabetic nephropathy (DN). While Ligustri Lucidi Fructus (LLF) is traditionally used in the treatment of DN, its precise mechanisms, particularly those involving mitochondria, remain poorly understood. This study identifies differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through differential expression analysis of the GSE142025 dataset, which includes data related to DN. Feature genes were selected from yielding overlapping genes by cross-referencing four distinct machine learning models. Genes with significant differential expression and consistent trends across both datasets were subjected to receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, and those with AUC > 0.7 in both datasets were defined as biomarkers. To investigate potential mechanisms of action, function enrichment, immune infiltration, network construction, and molecular docking analyses were performed. Finally, a DN mice model was constructed, further confirming the therapeutic effect of LLF on DN through assessments of blood glucose, urinary microalbumin levels, and histopathological examination. Meanwhile, the expression of these biomarkers was validated using RT-qPCR. The results indicated that four biomarkers were associated with mitochondria and related to the treatment of DN by LLF. These biomarkers were enriched in pathways related to ribosome function, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and peroxisomes. All biomarkers were negatively correlated with CD8+ T cells and activated mast cells while showing positive correlations with activated NK cells and naive B cells. Additionally, the binding energies of taxifolin, beta-sitosterol, and eriodictyol with the biomarkers were all below -5 kcal/mol. Animal experiments have confirmed that LLF significantly upregulates the expression of CAT and MAOA genes in kidney tissue. Identifying mitochondrial biomarkers for LLF treatment of DN offers novel insights into therapeutic strategies for the disease.",

Here, we proposed the concept of silencer transcriptional activity (STA) to investigated silencers from a new perspective using >20,000 transcriptomes. We demonstrated that lower STAs predicted better patient outcomes in most cancers, and a subset of STAs distinguished tumors from noncancerous tissues for most cancer types. Importantly, we discovered a silencer-linked RNA (slRNA) of a leukemia cell-specific silencer (LeSSi). Knocking down (KD) of the slRNA significantly decreased leukemia cell viability and migration and increased cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, the direct link and functional similarity between LeSSi and slRNA were established by CRISPR/Cas9 knocking out (KO) of LeSSi. Mechanistically, the slRNA hijacked FOXP1, which functions here both as a known transcription factor (TF), and more importantly, as a novel RNA binding protein (RBP), thereby preventing FOXP1 from binding to the promoter of proto-oncogene MYC and subsequently promoting MYC transcription. Collectively, our work provides insights into the functions of silencers in cancer and identified a slRNA hijacking FOXP1 to enhance MYC expression in leukemia cells.",

We discovered a circulating dormancy-inducing factor in hibernating snails, synthesized it chemically and because it activates PHLPP1 (a phosphatase regulating the mTOR mediators p-AKT and p-S6K1), named it SNail Activator of PHLPP1 (SNAP). During IR, plasma membrane PHLPP1 and p-AKT translocate to the cytoplasm and mitochondria. SNAP dephosphorylates mitochondrial p-AKT, p-S6K1 and induces dormancy in snails and quiescence (autophagy, reversible cell-cycle exit, proteostasis, apoptosis-resistance) in ischemic mouse fibroblasts. In IR models of cardiomyocytes and perfused hearts, SNAP is cardioprotective by preserving Pyruvate Dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, preventing mitochondrial depolarization, apoptosis and ROS-induced ER stress. SNAP's cardioprotective and mitochondrial effects are absent in hearts with a cardiomyocyte-specific PDH knockout. SNAP reveals fundamental mechanisms of quiescence under stress; while its cardioprotection may be beneficial in the IR injury of normal hearts offered for transplantation, a major challenge in transplant medicine",

AVRA13 disrupts HvSRF3-HvBAK1 interaction and alters HvSRF3 plasma membrane levels. AVRa13-expression desensitizes iron-induced restriction of Bh growth, suggesting that AVRA13 facilitates fungal proliferation by manipulating SRF3-mediated iron homeostasis.

This age-related aneuploidy is primarily driven by premature sister chromatid separation (PSSC), resulting from loss of the cohesin complex that holds chromatids together. How cohesin is destabilized in the long-lived mammalian oocyte is poorly understood. Here, we show that in mouse oocytes, pericentromeric transcription is essential for maintaining the cohesion protector Shugoshin 1 (SGO1) and PP2A at centromeres, which together safeguard the cohesin subunit REC8. With age, mouse oocytes lose pericentromeric transcription, SGO1, and PP2A, leading to destabilized cohesion and increased PSSC. Supplementing aged mouse oocytes with Sgo1 restores centromeric protection, and reduces PSSC to youthful levels. Aged human oocytes also show reduced SGO1, and SGO1 supplementation reduces the fraction of human eggs with PSSC by approximately half. These findings establish SGO1 supplementation as a potential strategy to preserve chromatid cohesion in aging oocytes.",

    "summary": "Organisms rely on coordinated stress responses to maintain cellular homeostasis. Perhaps the best-known example of multiple stress inputs converging onto a single response is the integrated stress response (ISR), which reduces global translation under various stressed conditions to reduce the protein folding burden of the cell. Similarly, most stress responses generally involve coordination of additional protein homeostasis (proteostasis) pathways, including increased expression of chaperones to refold proteins, as well as activation of clearance mechanisms, such as autophagy and the ubiquitin proteosome system. Our study investigates how heat stress can influence coordinated activation of both cytosolic and ER chaperones, exploring bidirectional cross talk between canonical activators of the cytosolic heat-shock response (HSR) and the unfolded protein response of the ER (UPRER). Using robust transcriptional reporters in the C. elegans model system, we explore a non-canonical activation of the UPRER under heat stress by the coordinated effects of XBP-1 and HSF-1. We further investigate inter tissue communications of stress whereby neuronal or glial activation of the UPRER can result in heterotypic enhancement of the HSR in peripheral and can increase thermotolerance. This work highlights the complex convergence of cellular stress responses, a phenomenon that may reflect a general strategy wherein localized stress can activate numerous proteostasis pathways to prevent whole cell and whole organism damage.",

To better understand the function of this large exon, we performed proteomic analyses to identify interaction partners via this part of the protein. Here, we report a DNA damage- and phospho-dependent interaction of TOPBP1 to the protein region of BRCA1 encoded by exon 11. Mechanistically, this interaction is required for the role of BRCA1 in end-resection during homologous recombination.

    "summary": "Background Myogenic differentiation of muscle stem cells required for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration relies on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of multiple gene-expression programs. Over the past decades, considerable progress has been made in defining the transcriptional networks that govern myogenesis. In particular, myogenic transcription factors integrate extrinsic and intrinsic cues to drive skeletal muscle development and regeneration. In contrast, post-transcriptional layers of regulation have remained comparatively underexplored. Among these, the epitranscriptome -- comprising more than 170 chemical RNA modifications -- has recently emerged as a major regulatory axis in cellular differentiation. N-methyladenosine (mA), the most abundant internal modification of mRNA, is now recognized as a key regulator of stem-cell fate decisions across multiple biological systems. By dynamically modulating RNA stability, translation, and other processing steps, mA enables precise fine-tuning of gene-expression programs in response to physiological cues. These effects are mediated through mA-binding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), also referred to as readers, which selectively recognize methylated transcripts and translate the modification into functional cellular outcomes. Despite its central role in other tissue contexts, the contribution of mA to skeletal muscle physiology -- and particularly to human muscle stem cell biology -- remains poorly characterized. This gap represents a critical and largely unexplored frontier in muscle biology. Methods To define the epitranscriptome landscape during the myogenic differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells, we performed GLORI on proliferating and differentiated human primary myoblasts. This recently developed approach enables detection of mA at single-nucleotide resolution together with quantitative measurement of methylation stoichiometry at individual sites. mA-modified positions were mapped across the transcriptome in both cellular states and integrated with matched RNA-seq datasets data to contextualise mA features relative to transcript abundance. To place these findings in a broader context, we compared our human mA maps with previously published mouse muscle cell datasets and overlaid them with available CLIP-seq datasets of mA RNA-binding proteins. Results We identified tens of thousands of high-confidence mA sites in proliferating and differentiated human myogenic cells. While many sites were shared between states, myogenic differentiation was accompanied by epitranscriptomic remodeling, affecting both the distribution and stoichiometry of mA marks. Transcripts exhibiting differential mA regulation were enriched for pathways related to myogenic development, cytoskeletal remodeling, signalling, nucleic-acid-associated processes and energy metabolism. Joint analysis of mA site number, methylation stoichiometry, and expression levels indicated the presence of distinct mA regulatory frameworks at the transcript level. Genes associated with myogenesis and regulatory pathways were distributed across these categories, consistent with the coexistence of multiple regulatory programs during myogenic differentiation. In addition, cross-species comparisons revealed the presence of human-specific methylation patterns. Integration with published mA RNA-binding protein datasets uncovered distinct subsets of mA sites with varying binding profiles, suggesting state-dependent interpretation of mA marks. Together, these data constitute, to our knowledge, the first single-nucleotide-resolution atlas of mA methylation in human skeletal muscle, revealing a previously uncharacterized epitranscriptomic landscape and providing a foundational resource for studies of human myogenesis.",

    "summary": "DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are toxic DNA lesions formed by the covalent attachment of proteins to DNA. Failure to resolve DPCs leads to genomic instability, premature aging, and cancer predisposition. Although multiple proteases and the 26S proteasome degrade DPCs, how these lesions are detected and marked for proteolysis remains unclear. Here, we show that poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1/2) sense DPCs and modify them with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to promote repair via a SPRTN-Tdp1 axis. We discovered a Nudix homology domain (NHD) in SPRTN that mediates direct non-covalent PAR binding and is important for DPC repair. Loss of PARP1/2 activity or mutation of the SPRTN NHD leads to sustained DPCs. Single-molecule analysis revealed that SPRTN does not bind efficiently to the DPC, however after the addition of PARP1 in the presence of NAD+, SPRTN binding to the DPC was significantly increased. Our findings establish PARP1/2 enzymes as immediate DPC sensors, reveal PARylation as a signal marking DPCs for SPRTN-dependent degradation, and identify SPRTN as the first PARP-directed protease.",

Here we performed ultrastructural and proteomic analyses of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) alongside behavioral assessments of attentional set shifting in mice across age groups. Although reduced synaptic density did not consistently lead to cognitive decline, proteomic analyses of synaptosomes and whole tissue revealed that the molecular signatures associated with individual variability in cognitive decline were distinct from those associated with chronological aging, and that synaptic mitochondria and their proteins were more abundant in aged mice with greater cognitive decline. Moreover, treatment with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ reduced the abundance of synaptic mitochondrial proteins, including pro-apoptotic proteins, and mitigated age-related cognitive decline. These findings demonstrate that synaptic mitochondrial oxidative stress in the mPFC, distinct from chronological age-related processes, contributes to individual variability in age-related cognitive decline and offers a potential target for prevention and intervention.",

Here, we describe three individuals with brain malformations including PMG and microcephaly in whom de novo, missense mutations were identified in PANX1--encoding an ATP and ion conducting channel. We show that these PMG-associated PANX1 mutations (p.D14H, p.M37R, and p.N338T) disrupt normal glycosylation and confer gain-of-function with respect to ATP release and channel conductance. In vivo modeling of PANX1 mutant forms in cortical progenitor cells demonstrated disrupted cell migration and cell fate, including excess cell death in both mice and ferret models. Modeling the N338T allele in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons further revealed how conductance changes lead to functional consequences of increased excitability and synchronicity. Our results show that normal PANX1 function contributes to cortical structure through regulation of ion conductance and ATP release and provides insight into how these processes influence corticogenesis and cytoarchitecture more broadly.",

    "summary": "Translating CRISPR/Cas9-based homology-directed repair (HDR) strategies into clinical application remains a major challenge due to limited standardization, concerns over safety, and efficacy issues. Here, we present a comprehensive and clinically compliant preclinical framework for the ex vivo correction of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome (WAS) using a CRISPR/Cas9-AAV6 platform targeting hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). In this study, we established a clinical-compatible platform enabling large-scale manufacturing while preserving HSPC viability, stemness, and multilineage functionality. To overcome low HSPC long-term engraftment, we fine-tuned AAV dosing and transiently modulated p53 signalling, achieving significantly improved in vivo correction and repopulation. Importantly, we implemented a multi-tiered genotoxicity assessment strategy, integrating in silico, genome-wide, and orthogonal assays, revealing a largely favorable safety profile with minimal off-target risks and no signs of clonal dominance or transformation. Longitudinal in vivo safety monitoring revealed donor specific rare off-target events and structural variants. This highlights the crucial importance of patient monitoring after transplantation, further emphasized by the identification of a de novo chromosomal rearrangements that could be detected exclusively following cell engraftment in mice. This work offers a robust and adaptable roadmap for future HDR-based gene editing platforms, establishing critical benchmarks for efficacy, safety, and regulatory readiness in the development of advanced therapeutic medicinal products.",

    "summary": "Moult is a challenging stage in the life of birds. Small passerines replace plumage, substantial part of their body mass, annually to preserve its vital functions. Surprisingly, most species tend to downregulate corticosterone, major mediator of energy metabolism and stress response, during this energetically demanding period. Experimental studies suggest corticosterone has detrimental effect on feather quality and, within species, slows feather growth rate (FGR), prolonging the period when plumage functions are compromised. However, how exactly corticosterone affects moult in natural populations or on macroecological scale is not yet fully understood. In this study, we analysed corticosterone deposited in tail feathers (fCORT), a corticosterone cumulative measure across multiple days relevant to the moult, on an unprecedented sample of 87 passerine species from Europe and Afrotropics. Our data showed moderate between and high within-species repeatability, strengthening the usefulness of fCORT as a tress record across multiple species. We did not find any association of fCORT with either FGR or fault bar occurrence. Unlike circulating corticosterone, fCORT did not differ between latitudes. However, our data suggested higher fCORT in high elevation tropical species. More research is needed to understand how birds regulate corticosterone during moult and how it affects moult in natural populations.",

    "summary": "Immune dysfunction in cancer is enacted by multiple programs, including tumor cell-intrinsic responses to distinct immune subpopulations. A subset of these immune evasion programs can be systematically recapitulated through direct tumor-immune interactions in vitro. Here, we present an integrated, high-throughput single-cell CRISPR screening framework focused on the protein kinome for mapping the tumor-intrinsic regulation of T cell-driven immune pressure in glioblastoma (GBM). We combine pooled CRISPR interference and activation (CRISPRi/a) with immune-matched NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific allogeneic GBM-T cell co-culture and massively multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics to systematically quantify how genetic perturbation reshapes baseline tumor state and adaptive responses across graded effector-to-target ratios. We further leverage deep generative models for analyzing pooled CRISPR screens to decipher the effects of genetic perturbations on the mechanisms of tumor resistance. This framework resolves distinct modules of immune evasion and survival, including the regulation of the antigen-presentation machinery, interferon/NF-{kappa}B signaling, oxidative stress resilience, and checkpoint/cytokine programs, while identifying perturbations that reroute the continuous tumor transcriptional trajectory induced by T cell engagement. A secondary chemical screen in patient-derived GBM cultures identified putative kinase targets of immune evasion phenotypes (e.g., EPHA2 and PDGFRA), whose inhibition leads to the blockade of evasive programs and enhances T cell-mediated GBM killing. Together, this workflow provides a scalable blueprint for comprehensive charting of the genetic control of tumor-immune interactions.",

We developed a reverse molecular pharmacology approach that is based on high-throughput drug screening coupled with chemo-informatic and transcriptomic analyses. This led to the identification of IRAK1 as a key chemoresistance factor in neuroblastoma. By performing functional and pharmacological drug combination screens targeting IRAK1, we revealed a synergy between IRAK1 inhibition/silencing and BET, EGFR and mTOR inhibitors as well as microtubule-targeting agents. The synergistic combination of microtubule-targeting agent, vincristine and IRAK inhibitors was then confirmed in tumor spheroids, patient-derived tumoroids and a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model. Mechanistically, IRAK inhibition potentiated the pro-apoptotic and cell cycle arrest properties of vincristine via a pathway involving the PIDDosome complex rather than its canonical MyDDosome axis. Altogether, this study represents a proof-of-concept of our reverse molecular pharmacology approach to quickly develop biology-guided drug combinations, that could be applied to any other human diseases.",

Microglial repopulation after pharmacological depletion has been proposed as a strategy to alleviate microglia-driven neuropathology. However, the effects of microglial repopulation on age-related cognitive decline remain largely unexplored. In the present study, we examined how microglial repopulation affects the transcriptomic profiles of cortical microglia and the decline in prefrontal cortex-dependent cognitive function in aged mice. Experimental Approach Young and aged male C57BL/6J mice were used in this study. Microglial depletion was induced by treatment with PLX3397, a CSF1R inhibitor, followed by microglial repopulation after drug withdrawal. Microglia isolated from the entire cerebral cortex were subjected to bulk RNA-sequencing analysis. The visual discrimination test followed by the response direction test was conducted to assess sensory learning and attentional set shifting abilities, respectively. Key Results Repopulated cortical microglia in aged, but not young, mice exhibited aberrant gene expression patterns, including reduced expression of microglial identity genes, reprogramming of innate and adaptive immune-related gene expression, and derepression of neuronal gene expression. Furthermore, microglial repopulation selectively impaired visual discrimination learning and attentional set shifting in aged mice. Conclusion and Implications These findings demonstrate that aging converts microglial repopulation into maladaptive reprogramming that exacerbates cognitive decline, possibly through aberrant gene expression programs. Therefore, the therapeutic potential of this approach must be carefully evaluated with respect to specific behavioral domains and disease contexts, including aging.",

Combining behavioural modelling with high-density EEG, we show that older adults assign greater weight on prior information, resulting in stronger decisional bias and reduced sensory precision under probabilistic cues. Neural dynamics revealed a breakdown of anticipatory tuning in visual alpha rhythms, supporting sensory preparation in youth, alongside enhanced central beta activity, indicating a shift toward pre-emptive motor engagement aligned with expected responses. A data-driven decomposition further showed that, whereas prior-driven behaviour in younger adults emerges from a flexible interplay between sensory and executive oscillatory systems, it becomes dominated in aging by a rigid, response-centred mode. Together, these findings uncover a large-scale reconfiguration of predictive computations with age, marking a transition from adaptive sensory-executive coordination to a more automatized, action-oriented predictive strategy.",

    "summary": "Aims: Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) exhibit an immature structural and metabolic phenotype that limits their utility for cardiac disease modeling and regenerative therapy. Although multiple extrinsic strategies have been proposed to enhance iPSC-CM maturation, intrinsic molecular regulators governing this process remain incompletely defined. This study aimed to identify and characterize a novel molecular factor that promotes cardiomyocyte maturation. Methods and Results: Cross-species transcriptomic analyses comparing adult versus fetal hearts and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy versus healthy myocardium identified Isthmin-1 (ISM1) as a conserved maturation-associated gene. In human iPSC-CMs, ISM1 overexpression enhanced sarcomere organization, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production, and calcium-handling properties, whereas ISM1 knockdown impaired these maturation features. RNA sequencing revealed global transcriptional reprogramming toward an adult-like state, characterized by suppression of cell-cycle-related gene programs and activation of oxidative metabolic pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment, GSVA, and GSEA consistently identified p53 signaling as the most significantly activated pathway in ISM1-overexpressing iPSC-CMs. Mechanistically, ISM1 directly interacted with p53, enhanced its protein stability, promoted nuclear localization, and increased transcription of p53 downstream targets involved in metabolic remodeling and cell-cycle exit. Pharmacological inhibition of p53 abolished ISM1-induced structural and metabolic maturation, demonstrating that ISM1 promotes cardiomyocyte maturation in a p53-dependent manner. Conclusions: ISM1 is a previously unrecognized molecular driver of cardiomyocyte maturation that promotes structural, metabolic, and functional maturation of iPSC-CMs through activation of p53-dependent transcriptional programs. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into cardiomyocyte maturation and identify ISM1 as a promising target for improving the maturity of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.",

    "summary": "Schizophrenia (SZ) is increasingly framed as a disorder of large-scale brain networks emerging from atypical early neurodevelopment, yet how network architecture relates to cortical folding abnormalities remains unclear. Here, we introduce a sulcal morphological-centred network framework that integrates normative modelling of sulcal width with diffusion-derived structural connectivity and transcriptomic data in a large multisite cohort (n = 5,392; 377 SZ). Individuals with SZ showed widespread sulcal widening, affecting 30 of 40 sulci and most pronounced in frontal, temporal and occipital regions. Critically, sulci with higher degree centrality, reflecting greater embedding within the structural connectome, exhibited disproportionately greater widening in SZ (pspin = 0.02), indicating that network hubs of cortical folding are preferentially affected. Transcriptomic integration using partial least squares regression identified a single component explaining 56.5% of SZ-related sulcal widening variance (pperm = 0.041), implicating genes enriched for synaptic signalling and energy metabolism with adult cortical expression bias and genetic enrichment for cross-disorder psychiatric risk. In contrast, oppositely weighted genes showed prenatal expression bias and enrichment for rare disruptive variants in autism spectrum disorder. Together, these findings link aberrant sulcal morphology in SZ to the brain's network topology and molecular architecture, positioning cortical folding as a network-embedded phenotype in SZ.",

    "summary": "Genomic copy number variations, such as the 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, cause pleiotropic disorders that affect diverse organ systems and disrupt neurodevelopment. Deletions of the 22q11.2 locus reduce the dosage of up to 46 protein coding genes, raising questions about the identity of haploinsufficient genes and their genetic interactions contributing to 22q11.2 phenotypes. Here, we dissect functional and molecular relationships between two genes encoded within the 22q11.2 locus: the mitochondrial ribosomal protein gene MRPL40 and the mitochondrial citrate transporter SLC25A1. We show that a MRPL40 null mutation disrupts mitochondrial translation, impairs respiration, and affects multiple components of the SLC25A1 interactome including factors required for lipid metabolism, mitochondrial ribosome subunits, and the mitochondrial RNA processing machinery. In silico coessentiality network analysis revealed correlated and anticorrelated fitness interactions linking MRPL40 and SLC25A1 to mitochondrial translation, intermediate carbon metabolism, and interferon signaling. We determined that Mrpl40-null mutations are embryonic lethal in mice, but Mrpl40-/+ mice are viable and displayed embryonic cardiac development and adult behavioral phenotypes. Similarly, Slc25a1+/- animals showed embryonic cardiac developmental defects but lacked the adult behavioral phenotypes observed in Mrpl40-/+ mice. Surprisingly, transheterozygotic Slc25a1+/-;Mrpl40-/+ mice suppressed or mitigated cardiac development, behavioral, and brain transcriptome phenotypes observed in single heterozygotic animals. These results reveal that MRPL40 and SLC25A1 are haploinsufficient genes within the 22q11.2 locus that genetically and biochemically interact to define tissue development and physiology. Our findings provide a framework for understanding the complexity and type of gene dosage interactions within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome locus.",

    "summary": "Transcription by RNA Polymerase III (Pol III) is essential for ribosome biogenesis and translation in all cells, but pathogenic variants in genes encoding subunits of Pol III lead to tissue-specific phenotypes including craniofacial differences. To understand the function of Pol III in craniofacial development, we examined polr3a mutant zebrafish. These mutants display hypoplasia of the neural crest cell-derived craniofacial cartilage and bone but, surprisingly, no significant changes were observed in neural crest cell proliferation or survival during embryogenesis. At larval stages, increased cell death was observed throughout the head, including in the craniofacial cartilage. These changes coincide with reduced transcription of transfer RNAs and reduced ribosome biogenesis in polr3a mutant zebrafish. To determine tissue-specific transcriptional changes, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing. Analysis revealed both global and cartilage-specific changes, including upregulation of tp53. However, Tp53 inhibition alone was not sufficient to rescue craniofacial cartilage and bone, indicating that additional factors are important to support cartilage and bone growth in polr3a mutants. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insights into the functions of Pol III in craniofacial development.",
